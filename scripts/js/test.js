I have taught CS241 many times in the past although Lawrence Angrave has taken over and I don't get to torture you guys anymore. So it's not as much fun anymore. But he is out having fun in warm sunny California for the next two classes which means you are stuck with me. For better or worse","width":2066},{"text":"Anyway, he gave me all the information to teach you guys. I didn't even have to give you the quiz that was done already. So we are going to focus today on some of the synchronization problems that he started on. ","width":924},{"text":"And get through hopefully deadlock on Wednesday. ","width":292},{"text":"So he left you talking about the reader-writer problems, producer-consumer problems, and one of the things that was assumed was that to make these entities talk to each other that there is some shared space between them. And I don't think there was any restrictions put on how he told you what this space would be. So in the best of all worlds we might just have an infinite buffer where we have somebody put some data in on one side and somebody taking it out on the other side and I could infinitely put in as much data as I want and take out as much data as was put in","width":3243},{"text":"But in reality we know that infinity is never infinity. We can't implement infinity in a system","width":598},{"text":"So what we want to talk about today is understand what kind  of data structures and what kind of resources we can use to implement these shared data applications.","width":749},{"text":"So where one application is writing into a buffer and another application is reading from a buffer.","width":340},{"text":"...","width":5088},{"text":"So if we're dealing with entities where we have a producer and a consumer ","width":990},{"text":"And they are putting data into some buffer and the consumer is taking data out of there. What kind of limitations do we have if we're going to implement in this way? What's the first thing?","width":1783},{"text":"Well at some point once I've filled up the queue I can only take things out as fast as the consumer is consuming them","width":544},{"text":"Vice versa I can only consume as fast as they're produced. But this is not an infinite buffer","width":461},{"text":"So what happens is the producer puts something in and puts a couple of things in and now the consumer is going to take them out","width":1207},{"text":"And we put some more things in","width":312},{"text":"Now I want to put something else in. What do I do?","width":227},{"text":"I've hit the end of my buffer","width":417},{"text":"We can rotate around and wrap","width":197},{"text":"So let's let the producer now say let's go all the way back there and I can put my next thing in here","width":576}],

say","width":932},{"text":"ok","width":96},{"text":"that works too","width":142},{"text":"when i'm done","width":103},{"text":"so don't do this","width":647},{"text":"you could also if you really wanted to say n = n mod 16","width":250},{"text":"that'll work too","width":112},{"text":"but that's not even that necesasry","width":133},{"text":"you only  have to change it if it is 16","width":439},{"text":"and i have to do the same for what?","width":154},{"text":"","width":0},{"text":"for out","width":65},{"text":"so not going to write that but i have to do the same for out","width":656},{"text":"so","width":195},{"text":"we've already hit on a bunch of problems that has to do with this. and the problem is all the overwriting and","width":511},{"text":"that uh we're not being careful about wha'ts going on","width":213},{"text":"and really the challenge here is there's no synchronization","width":303},{"text":"","width":2},{"text":"i'm not synchrnoizing my readers

time","width":183},{"text":"is there any safety there?","width":100},{"text":"no","width":43},{"text":"so let's assume that ","width":218},{"text":"we use this code","width":146},{"text":"for the

underflow","width":104},{"text":"and from the synchronization problem of two nodes trying to put something in the qeueue at the same time and overwriting each other","width":575},{"text":"so we have

listening","width":144.18181824684143},{"text":"yes, when you have a PIPE and you write some bytes to the pipe and there's no one there to listen","width":508.18181824684143},{"text":"and the failure [will cause your process to] get a SIGPIPE so you can write some code inside your signal handlers to say oh look the listeners died, maybe I'll just fork exec a new one for example","width":686.1818182468414},{"text":"now a common gotcha though is when your playing with pipes and fork as you might have found out in the lab, is that you forget to close all of those file handles that you don't need","width":618.1818182468414},{"text":"so if you still happen to have a reading file descriptor open, you won't get the signal because in theory you could still read form that","width":698.1818182468414},{"text":"okay, so that's our first little question right","width":428.18181824684143},{"text":"alright so when all the readers have closed and you try to write to a pipe, you should get a signal","width":1093.1818182468414},{"text":"in practice we've found it doesn't actually work on EWS","width":218.18181824684143},{"text":"the old EWS machines don't support

this machine","width":273.18181824684143},{"text":"but it is important because hey with this box you've got root","width":195.18181824684143},{"text":"you can do root-y things like mount file systems,

pipes off","width":146.18181824684143},{"text":"so when can a listener discover that there are no more writers","width":237.18181824684143},{"text":"how about this then, because in section our listener right was wc, we were using word count to pull data from standard in","width":625.1818182468414},{"text":"how do you think wc knew that the pipe had closed, that there was no more bytes coming","width":730.1818182468414},{"text":"okay so we had to flush it but actually we had to do more than flush","width":189.18181824684143},{"text":"flush simply says to the C library hey you know those bytes you're looking after for performance sake","width":334.18181824684143},{"text":"I don't want you to look after them anymore","width":96.18181824684143},{"text":"send them down the pipe, in other words call write","width":227.18181824684143},{"text":"but we need to do more than that because flushing doesn't actually mean that the pipe itself has closed","width":369.18181824684143},{"text":"we want to close it but we haven't actually answered the question yet of how does the listener know when it's not going to get anymore bytes","width":724.1818182468414},{"text":"and the answer is if you call read, it returns zero","width":512.1818182468414},{"text":"so it's not an error yet, it's just simply that hey I'm going to give you zero bytes and the pipe is closed","width":736.1818182468414},{"text":"so let's do this","width":243.18181824684143},{"text":"let's have a little play","width":207.18181824684143},{"text":"okie dokie right so I made a pipe ","width":279.18181824684143},{"text":"I'm going to close the second file descriptor, in other words the write end","width":283.18181824684143},{"text":"and let's try reading from it","width":204.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so bytes read equals read","width":216.18181824684143},{"text":"we need to give it a file descriptor okay so what shall I say","width":270.18181824684143},{"text":"fd[0] is where we read from, how many bytes do we want? well here's a pointer to buffer and I'll take sizeof buffer minus one","width":582.1818182468414},{"text":"why minus one you say? well for safety for example I might put in at the very end a termination byte","width":583.1818182468414},{"text":"for example, just to make sure my strings don't go on forever","width":236.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so let's print out to see what value we get","width":277.18181824684143},{"text":"okay and I want to print out the result of my read call","width":844.1818182468414},{"text":"hey and look it's true, we do get zero, fantastic okay go away","width":333.18181824684143},{"text":"right so that's one way right? now that's obviously if we're doing the low level calls like read and write","width":515.1818182468414},{"text":"if your working at the C library level","width":349.18181824684143},{"text":"you can check for an end of file EOF condition on that pointer","width":744.1818182468414},{"text":"so remember how we do fdopen to get yourself a C library pointer","width":261.18181824684143},{"text":"well then there's a thing called fopen","width":256.18181824684143},{"text":"right so that's relatively easy then to discover that something is closed","width":306.18181824684143},{"text":"another way of doing it of course is that you come up with a special token or special character to say hey if I send them asterisks or a zero bytes, then I know that that signifies to me that there's no more bytes coming","width":745.1818182468414},{"text":"another way is to say at the beginning of your message, hey I'm going to send exactly 4000 bytes and here they come","width":402.18181824684143},{"text":"another way is to know exactly how many bytes you are going to send beforehand anyway and hard code it into your program","width":437.18181824684143},{"text":"so that's all we're going to say about pipes today","width":313.18181824684143},{"text":"let's mess up our program, let's try and read from a file

going to happen now?","width":680.1818182468414},{"text":"alright we get a result of negative one","width":171.18181824684143},{"text":"the read failed, I cannot read from file descriptor 123","width":259.18181824684143},{"text":"well you and I know that's because there's nothing connected to that integer","width":240.18181824684143},{"text":"it's an invalid file descriptor","width":156.18181824684143},{"text":"but we want to actually know more than that, we want to know something about what went wrong","width":409.18181824684143},{"text":"and for that there's actually this global constant called, whoops come back thank you, errno","width":750.1818182468414},{"text":"right error number, so error number will have been

here we said about we are configuring it","width":414},{"text":"um we could get address info","width":146},{"text":"to setup the real struct for us","width":231},{"text":"and then we can use it so now here's the um","width":276},{"text":"here's the main part","width":188},{"text":"write a socket","width":264},{"text":"call connect","width":197},{"text":"so in a sense","width":164},{"text":"making a client actually requires two calls","width":203},{"text":"get a socket and ask that socket to connect to something","width":145},{"text":"that's not quite true because we are using this getaddressinfo to help us make the connect call","width":399},{"text":"but this is the actual part, if we actually know exactly what we wanted to put","width":253},{"text":"set it to connect, we won't need to be calling getaddressinfo","width":200},{"text":"that's just a helper method for us","width":164},{"text":"actually it's just these two calls: hey i want a socket, and hey please connect to somewhere. please connect to BBC and here's the IP address. right","width":619},{"text":"alright so um","width":209},{"text":"last semester","width":115},{"text":"no, last lecture","width":156},{"text":"i lied to you","width":131},{"text":"just a little bit","width":144},{"text":"i said getaddressinfo returns a struct of these addressinfo objects. well that's kind of true","width":865},{"text":"actually, it returns a linkedlist of them","width":301},{"text":"so here's what happens, you say, look, in my hints","width":205},{"text":"i would like a certain kind of connection, like, i would like, say, IP 4, for example","width":558},{"text":"and i would like, say, a stream based port for, say, TCP","width":409},{"text":"getaddressinfo says, okay you wanna get this remote host, i will find all of the possible ways","width":397},{"text":"to set up a socket and connect to the remote host and return it to you","width":312},{"text":"and that's what we get, we get a whole lot of these addrinfoes","width":215},{"text":"now and for our little code inside CS 241, don't worry about that, just use the very first one that it gives back to you","width":387},{"text":"assuming of course that getaddressinfo gives us a success","width":281},{"text":"result code","width":86},{"text":"but if you are writing a more verbose server, you might say i wanna connect to the BBC","width":238},{"text":"and i don't care if you can find a good IP 4 connection or good IP 6 connection i know what i'll just try both","width":613},{"text":"alright so, in fact you get this linkedlist","width":336},{"text":"alright so what have we got inside this addrinfo ","width":168},{"text":"alright we've seen these um, this half up here which is kind of a description of what we want","width":413},{"text":"this is the stuff that we are probably gonna be using in our code later on","width":300},{"text":"and that is this structure here, sockaddr","width":293},{"text":"and also the number of bytes in that address","width":190},{"text":"so you'll be seeing us passing those addresss. so you'll be seeing us passing those two fields","width":191},{"text":"into our connect call and our bind calls in a little bit","width":251},{"text":"ok so watch out for these, so this is the stuff that is setting up for us so we don't need to set up","width":501},{"text":"ok alright so we got our addrinfos","width":286},{"text":"alright so","width":128},{"text":"how many addrinfoes does it return? 0, 1 or more?","width":310},{"text":"i promise you that we'll never return you a negative number","width":297},{"text":"OK um. ","width":152},{"text":"one little thing that you might notice on the code before which is that if getaddressinfo fails","width":680},{"text":"you can't use perror() or structerror","width":342},{"text":"no, it doesn't set error number like that it's got its own error","width":427},{"text":"error code that you could use to return an error","width":371},{"text":"and we'll look that up in a bit","width":95},{"text":"instead i wanna charge through this because I actually want to get to the demo today","width":157},{"text":"the demo is the most fun","width":79},{"text":"but so what is AF_INET6?","width":177},{"text":"what kind of address family is this","width":267},{"text":"it is, yes, IP 6","width":298},{"text":"IP version 6. well we can talk about nodes we can talk about hosts, we can talk about machines","width":374},{"text":"using 128 bits of addressing","width":150},{"text":"in other words our address base is much larger","width":147},{"text":"alright so it's gonna take us a while to exhaust 2^128 possible addresses","width":702},{"text":"so IP version 6 was created because people foresaw the problem that hey we are starting to run out of addresses with IP version 4","width":954},{"text":"so what do you think this might be","width":297},{"text":"I'll give you a clue","width":660},{"text":"there's no place like home","width":113},{"text":"this is how we talk about our localhost ","width":244},{"text":"using IP version 6. so if you want to hack yourself using IP version 6, this is the address you need to connect to","width":527},{"text":"there is actually a shorthand for this where we can collapse the longest ones and zeros","width":371},{"text":"and so there the shortest version of this is just ::1","width":266},{"text":"i'm not gonna talk about all the rules about collapsing IP version 6 addresses","width":356},{"text":"you're welcome to look them up but i guarantee you that they won't be on the exams. the wikipedia references is perfectly good enough","width":385},{"text":"if you ever need to actually need to talk about IP version 6 addresses","width":207},{"text":"but that's the shortest IP address IP v 6 address.","width":431},{"text":"and yes this might be on the exam or this should become acknowledged that hey, this is yourself and this is localhost","width":384}],
// Part 1
[{"text":"okay so lets see if we can set this up then","width":540},{"text":"I'm going to start writing some code then to make a TCP conneciton","width":319},{"text":"so yes we need to setup one of these int objects","width":242},{"text":"and we'll have a pointer as well to get the result","width":186},{"text":"so what should i set for the family?","width":508},{"text":"well if i want to connect with version 4 I would be connecting with IF_INET6","width":530},{"text":"if i want to do ip version 6 i would put a 6 in here","width":480},{"text":"and what about the socket","width":95},{"text":"Well we want a stream based protocol","width":151},{"text":"in other words TCP","width":104},{"text":"so for our socket type we specify socket stream","width":439},{"text":"if i had left these entries as zero","width":278},{"text":"we're basically saying hey we don't care","width":154},{"text":"and then we get back that linkedlist","width":145},{"text":"what are you connect to the BBC using the UDP","width":169},{"text":"using um datagrams","width":111},{"text":"you could connect using tcp","width":62},{"text":"and these would just be different entries in that linkedlist","width":271},{"text":"and then your code could try them all","width":116},{"text":"hey lets see if we can get a webpage over udp","width":212},{"text":"and the answer is actually quite a few webservers will do that","width":201},{"text":"they'll look at you strangely and go what do you want?","width":153},{"text":"but they will actually say okay I'll give you back some data as a single packet","width":354},{"text":"right so right we're going to fill this in","width":315},{"text":"ok so what do we put in here","width":148},{"text":"our function call of course is get address info","width":375},{"text":"and what do we pass over here","width":83},{"text":"well we need to pass in the hints","width":274},{"text":"and we need to pass in our reult","width":301},{"text":"okay, so lets see if your neighbor can first of all the mistakes i've just deliberately made in that code","width":606},{"text":"and also what are the two missing things that I need to fill in here","width":421},{"text":"what are the first two parameters","width":164},{"text":"so what mistakes did I make and what's missing in that code","width":6645},{"text":"okay right so ","width":178},{"text":"couple a mistakes we made","width":80},{"text":"first of all actually we want the address of our hint struct","width":205},{"text":"so we'll put an ampersand there","width":117},{"text":"and also we want the address of this pointer","width":179},{"text":"it's going to change that pointer for us","width":348},{"text":"ok so what do we pass in here?","width":132},{"text":"well we pass in sometimes it's called the node but you can think of it as just basically the machine we want to connect to","width":368},{"text":"so we could write www.illinois.edu","width":194},{"text":"we could write www.bbc","width":120},{"text":"we could write we could say for example do ::1 if we wanted to connect to ourselves using IP6","width":544},{"text":"we could write 127.0.0.1","width":366},{"text":"if we wanted to connect to ourselves and we were using ip4","width":378},{"text":"for here, i'm going to now specify the port","width":146},{"text":"and you can do this with two ways you can literally just write a string","width":235},{"text":"like 1234","width":383},{"text":"but for well known ports like HTTP, HTTPs you can actually write the protocol name","width":575},{"text":"like HTTPS ","width":451},{"text":"if you happen to know the port number, yeah you could use that","width":416},{"text":"so get address info is surprisingly useful","width":166},{"text":"if you give it a ASCII name it will try to convert that to a port number","width":332},{"text":"for you","width":639},{"text":"so if it returns zero we've succeeded","width":357},{"text":"if it fails now we can actually find out why","width":226},{"text":"and that's where that function comes in ","width":267},{"text":"we could call gai_strerror and pass in that result code","width":725},{"text":"and that would give us back string","width":246},{"text":"okay now I'm not going to expect you to remember that, the string error","width":346},{"text":"but what you might do as a system programmer","width":251},{"text":"with this networking code and in fact any time you want to write good code","width":251},{"text":"is check the manpages","width":93},{"text":"so if we were to go to manpages","width":194},{"text":"is this going to work here we go","width":92},{"text":"alright","width":200},{"text":"we see that um okay i can take the return ","width":298},{"text":"if i now read the description and the return value of this it would tell me that hey this integer can be plugged into this call","width":461},{"text":"to give me a basic message about what went wrong","width":256},{"text":"and let's have a quick look down here to see the kind of things that can go wrong","width":338},{"text":"we have a bad family bad flags","width":253},{"text":"no data no name","width":136},{"text":"this call can fail in all sorts of ways","width":186},{"text":"we might fail at turning a name like bbc.com into an ip address","width":599},{"text":"okay but lets say it worked","width":214},{"text":"what do we do next","width":102},{"text":"well the first thing we might do is okay let's make a new socket","width":318},{"text":"now you seen in some of my earlier examples that i've made the socket at the very beginning of the code","width":243},{"text":"and i hardcoded in exactly what family and type of socket type I wanted","width":559},{"text":"but you could also just use the return values","width":256}],
// Part 2
[{"text":"there we go","width":86},{"text":"we've also go the information we need inside here to actually create the socket","width":256},{"text":"so if you expect you'll get address info to return maybe an IP6 ","width":382},{"text":"maybe multiple kinds of different sockets","width":157},{"text":"then you'd be pulling that information out of that linkedlist each time","width":277},{"text":"so we've called socket and then we would try","width":441},{"text":"to connect to that remote host","width":275},{"text":"and let's say we've successfully got a connection","width":176},{"text":"hey great we're now talking to that machine","width":243},{"text":"right so this connect call is heavy it's big it's slow ","width":310},{"text":"it actually goes out there and connects","width":149},{"text":"it doesn't just like \"oh, connect please\" it's \"no make contact\"","width":238},{"text":"send some packets to and from that machine","width":267},{"text":"so connect might take a second or more to complete","width":212},{"text":"might take a minute","width":131},{"text":"if you're remote server you're trying to connect to is a long way away","width":303},{"text":"so this is potentially very very slow","width":213},{"text":"how quickly you can talk to the remote machine","width":364},{"text":"if you're trying to talk to yourself that should be pretty fast","width":323},{"text":"so you could talk to yourself very quickly and discover if you can connect to a particular port","width":491},{"text":"there's one thing we didn't talk about yet","width":177},{"text":"and that is ","width":288},{"text":"this magic call called bind","width":299},{"text":"so usually we don't like to be bound up","width":340},{"text":"but today we're going to be calling bind on our socket","width":250},{"text":"we're going to take our socket and we're going to bind it to a particular local port","width":494},{"text":"we're gonna say \"hey! use this local port\"","width":258},{"text":"now most of the time when you want to connect to a remote server","width":124},{"text":"you don't care where your packets leave from","width":170},{"text":"you don't care which port is used locally","width":213},{"text":"just let the operating system let the kernel choose the outgoing port","width":368},{"text":"but when we want to make a server typically we do care","width":150},{"text":"if I'm going to make a webserver I want it to be on port 80","width":457},{"text":"so we can use bind if we want to set the ","width":561},{"text":"local port","width":507},{"text":"you could also use it if you've got say two network cards","width":200},{"text":"and you want to specifically use a particular network card","width":592},{"text":"but it controls the local side of the connection","width":1433},{"text":"","width":2},{"text":"which is exactly what we're going to need when we make a server","width":649},{"text":"","width":1},{"text":"so if i tried to connect to your cellphone right now on a particular port","width":545},{"text":"i'd probably discover that it's not listening on that particular port that I was connect to","width":247},{"text":"connect would return back and say haha I'm sorry I've failed","width":215},{"text":"I've managed to send a packet and it said nothing ","width":193},{"text":"i didn't get anything back","width":91},{"text":"for your cellphone","width":54},{"text":"so connect fails","width":178},{"text":"what we ought to do in the server is the opposite","width":305},{"text":"we want to sit here and wait for people to come to us","width":275},{"text":"wait for packets to come to us","width":107},{"text":"wait for packets to come to our port","width":158},{"text":"what we want then is a passive connection","width":207},{"text":"not something that goes out and tries to connect","width":140},{"text":"but just sits there and says huh no let us the packets come to us","width":349},{"text":"we can do this","width":119},{"text":"and it's very very easy","width":272},{"text":"alright so a passive socket level one understanding is just hey it waits for connections to connect to it","width":623},{"text":"it's sitting on the key side of the particular port saying okay I'm on port 80 send your packets to me I'm ready","width":413},{"text":"and when they do I'm going to do something special","width":151},{"text":"right so what's a passive socket ","width":121},{"text":"first of all it's a socket that is listening ","width":254},{"text":"it's also known sometimes as a server socket","width":414},{"text":"because we use it for serving we just it for waiting for connections","width":358},{"text":"so it's passive in the sense that it's waiting for connections","width":705},{"text":"and it has a cute little trick","width":610},{"text":"","width":1},{"text":"lets say I'm the client, you're the server","width":182},{"text":"can you catch?","width":252},{"text":"let's say you're the server","width":78},{"text":"right there you go","width":307},{"text":"that ladies and gentlemen is a dropped packet","width":338},{"text":"alright here","width":237},{"text":"that server wasn't listening","width":588},{"text":"okay fantastic right","width":130},{"text":"so I've sent my-k-I've just connected to the server","width":339},{"text":"on the passive socket","width":63},{"text":"now here's what the passive socket does","width":197},{"text":"when it returns the connection, when it does the handshake back to me","width":446},{"text":"thank you","width":167},{"text":"it sends an additional piece of information which is","width":183},{"text":"don't talk to me, don't talk to that port anymore","width":199},{"text":"I've got a new port set up just there","width":321},{"text":"that is the special connection that is just between you and me","width":417},{"text":"so we'll see that in a moment on the C side as well ","width":127},{"text":"we'll see that on the seaside, I like that","width":110},{"text":"so we'll see that in terms an additional file descriptor","width":263},{"text":"that's part of that handshaking","width":139},{"text":"once we make the connection on the server side,","width":124},{"text":"no no we have a completely different port just for that one connection","width":347},{"text":"why do we do that?","width":60},{"text":"well guess what we're making a server","width":135},{"text":"we're trying to take over the world or whatever","width":120},{"text":"and other people might be connecting to port 80","width":210},{"text":"as soon as they do that they're going to be talking to you again","width":195},{"text":"so in order to keep all these connections separated","width":227},{"text":"we push them onto different ports","width":284},{"text":"alright so the time you actually spend talking to this particular port is minimal","width":330},{"text":"okay so why do we create one","width":181},{"text":"so we can have a server","width":529},{"text":"I want to make a server","width":231},{"text":"right so how do i do all this","width":199},{"text":"have I put this in yet no","width":86},{"text":"so here's what we should do ","width":136},{"text":"in our hints struct","width":389},{"text":"we're going to specify one more thing","width":209},{"text":"let's go back to here","width":62},{"text":"something we haven't used yet is this flags","width":808},{"text":"and there's a flag to say","width":181},{"text":"hey make a passive socket for me please","width":517},{"text":"trying to think if it's yeah must be uppercase right","width":646},{"text":"so before making your get address info call, just say oh, by the way, I would like a passive socket","width":576},{"text":"by the way i would like a passive socket","width":256}],

[{"text":"now if we were to run our code by the way","width":1253},{"text":"I didn't talk about this little guy in here","width":234},{"text":"what did you think he's there for?","width":456},{"text":"right? this little tiny question mark is the ultimate april fools in the sense that this will get you every day of the year","width":557},{"text":"this is C going oh you mean you didn't set all of the parameters in a field?","width":509},{"text":"don't worry, I'll make your code work today","width":311},{"text":"but, if we don't set all the fields inside a struct, then who's to know what the values are of the ones that we didn't set","width":443},{"text":"now maybe you made it in global memory","width":314},{"text":"and you know that there's going to be zero but if we didn't","width":223},{"text":"if we just made it on the stack","width":128},{"text":"then who knows what those global fields are going to be","width":301},{"text":"and we're just giving them to the operating system","width":133},{"text":"so who knows how getaddressinfo is going to interpret those unset fields","width":433},{"text":"so I'm talking about these in terms of setting up network code but this is actually a common common gotcha with C","width":353},{"text":"is you hey I've got a struct, I'll set a few things and I forget to set the other fields","width":435},{"text":"so right how can I fix that? well I showed you before","width":178},{"text":"one way is to call memset","width":101},{"text":"okay so how about we do this? memset on the hints","width":877},{"text":"sizeof(hints)","width":288},{"text":"zero","width":159},{"text":"and I can relax that I've now got job security","width":307},{"text":"my code will work!","width":535},{"text":"haha april fools","width":697},{"text":"so what have I just done?","width":128},{"text":"I've just managed to set zero number of bytes","width":216},{"text":"to a small integer value","width":164},{"text":"in other words the memset call I just made had no effect whatsoever","width":385},{"text":"because I accidentally swapped these two values around","width":586},{"text":"I suggest that you ideally just don't make this mistake","width":685},{"text":"or don't make this mistake in production code","width":305},{"text":"because the worst thing about it is that you probably won't realize it, you probably won't notice it right?","width":273},{"text":"the memory half the time is zero","width":140},{"text":"and it's only when say you are reusing old stack memory that you might not get nonzero values","width":371},{"text":"so watch out, watch out anytime you work directly with memory","width":235},{"text":"that's the most likely time that you'll get some very subtle bugs","width":484},{"text":"right so we've got our thing set up","width":158},{"text":"getaddressinfo is returning zero, it's working, right so...","width":394},{"text":"here's what we can do now","width":190},{"text":"remember how I said...","width":228},{"text":"in a client we make a socket and then we call connect","width":337},{"text":"and we connect to a remote end","width":109},{"text":"in a server, we go socket and bind","width":600},{"text":"we're not trying to connect to a remote end at all","width":260},{"text":"we're just saying ha I just want to set up a local socket here","width":189},{"text":"that doesn't connect to anything, it's just going to sit there and listen","width":200},{"text":"and all the parameters that we pass to connect to the same ones as bind","width":263},{"text":"so we're going to be passing in...","width":250},{"text":"these two again, this address and that length of that struct","width":215},{"text":"we'll see the real code in a moment","width":94},{"text":"but basically we've swapped our connect for a bind","width":195},{"text":"because we want to talk about not a remote endpoint but a local endpoint","width":342},{"text":"right... so at this point we'll just take a little bit of a break to","width":702},{"text":"mention these guys","width":285},{"text":"and also to kind of show you what the code might look like if you didn't have getaddressinfo","width":939},{"text":"so when setting up a socket","width":386},{"text":"one of the things we want to talk about then is the port address and the IP address","width":549},{"text":"and you'll notice if you do a lot of google searching on code, you'll quickly come across these functions here","width":330},{"text":"this htonl and htons","width":499},{"text":"here's what they do, they swap bytes around","width":354},{"text":"sometimes","width":140},{"text":"they swap bytes if you run this on an x86 intel machine","width":493},{"text":"why?","width":141},{"text":"why do you think we might want to swap the ordering of bytes?","width":716},{"text":"security?","width":276},{"text":"good idea but not the answer I was looking for","width":210},{"text":"endianness yes!","width":208},{"text":"so endianness why do we care about endianness well the point is we're sending information over the wire right?","width":443},{"text":"we're sending stuff out to the network, we don't want it to depend on the order with which we represent integers","width":415},{"text":"so if we're talking about a particular port number","width":151},{"text":"that's sixteen bits","width":104},{"text":"we better agree when we send the packet out on the network as to whether we want to put the low byte first or the upper byte first","width":594},{"text":"so network order is big endian","width":321},{"text":"and that should be independent of our machine","width":150},{"text":"so if the kernel says by the way, this remote host is connected to you on this particular port","width":405},{"text":"or here's this ip addresses","width":209},{"text":"we better be careful, these integers may not actually be the integers that we normally understand","width":373},{"text":"we may actually have to deliberately read that value with the bytes swapped","width":538},{"text":"so that's where these functions come in","width":124},{"text":"if you happen to compiling this code on a little endian machine","width":291},{"text":"big endian machine, they don't do anything, they are a no op they don't need to swap any bytes","width":291},{"text":"if you call them on an intel machine however, they give you the result with the bytes correctly swapped from big endian order to little endian order","width":576}],

short","width":195},{"text":"[silence]","width":1129},{"text":"so here's an example","width":179},{"text":"where we want to specify the port","width":211},{"text":"as port 1100","width":182},{"text":"notice how I chose a port greater than 1024 ","width":189},{"text":"and I want to set it directly into this structure here","width":291},{"text":"socket address","width":285},{"text":"and so I have to remember to actually set this up to be the network","width":455},{"text":"the network port number","width":308},{"text":"so this port number is actually going to be passed directly into the network card we're going to assemble the packet and that packet will have these bytes in now the correct order to say okay [something] on this particular port","width":1085},{"text":"you can use these inside your own code","width":205},{"text":"let's say you wanted to have a high performance server","width":236},{"text":"and you're not going to send ascii information, you actually want to send binary information","width":236},{"text":"and you want to send say the position of your players to all of the other, you want to cast it out to all of the order players on your game server","width":768},{"text":"you would have to decide on your protocol to say am I going to send this out in little endian or big endian format","width":312},{"text":"and you could use these kinds of calls to make sure that it doesn't matter whether your C code is compiling on an ARM platform an Intel platform","width":591},{"text":"that we always on the network are sending bytes out in the same order","width":368},{"text":"same endianness ","width":154},{"text":"alright so that's just a little aside, you'll see these codes and now you know what they do","width":250},{"text":"and here's the other one where you use it for a long so you can use it for 32 bits","width":434},{"text":"right so okay right","width":291},{"text":"so it's quite often said that setting up a server takes four cores","width":285},{"text":"we better say what they are","width":233},{"text":"and it's a common exam question or interview question to say what's the order of these?","width":306},{"text":"and what does each one do?","width":162},{"text":"right so the first one is easy, hey we need a socket","width":181},{"text":"you're not going to get very far without a socket","width":112},{"text":"we need a way to configure our network","width":339},{"text":"and a socket gives us back a file descriptor that we can then start to use","width":248},{"text":"once we've got that file descriptor","width":289},{"text":"we want to bind it to a local port","width":921},{"text":"let's bind it so we are now going to be on a particular local part and we set it up, we pass it","width":627},{"text":"now actually we're ready to go","width":145},{"text":"here's the nice thing that we can do with server sockets","width":269},{"text":"we can ask the kernel to do that little handoff trick and to start queuing up any connections","width":364},{"text":"so now we can start listening","width":213},{"text":"at that moment...","width":204},{"text":"we're live!","width":71},{"text":"our kernel is starting to actually accept connections for us","width":266},{"text":"and we'll generate a small queue of incoming connections that we can now start to process","width":375},{"text":"so with listen, we actually specify the queue size","width":660},{"text":"so as part of that little handoff process when we say oh actually go and reconnect to me next time on this other port number","width":396},{"text":"now the kernel has taken that and said okay by the way expect connections on this other port number, so internally its got a little queue","width":516},{"text":"when we want it from our user's side, we call...","width":339},{"text":"yes I'm prepared to accept this reverse call","width":520},{"text":"accept!","width":411},{"text":"so on the server side, when you call accept, you get...","width":407},{"text":"a new file descriptor","width":268},{"text":"okay so here's a big gotcha","width":156},{"text":"is that you've now actually got two file descriptors to play with","width":222},{"text":"if you want to be talking to your clients that are connecting","width":226},{"text":"this is one","width":202},{"text":"you get a new file descriptor each time accept returns","width":397},{"text":"also, this blocks","width":634},{"text":"until we have a client","width":243},{"text":"if your code is a bit slow in calling accept","width":185},{"text":"don't panic, that's why we called listen","width":148},{"text":"listen says look uhh my user code may not be able to call it except immediately so have a little backlog of connections that the kernel will maintain","width":720},{"text":"and hopefully I'll be able to call accept in the future","width":169},{"text":"so its very simple code, very simple server","width":306},{"text":"we can just call accept once, and that's it and that's what we'll do in a demo in a moment","width":231},{"text":"later can call accept in the loop to process one client at a time","width":399},{"text":"probably not going to be the best webserver in the world","width":222},{"text":"but hey it works and we can run that on some tiny embedded hardware","width":331},{"text":"later we might do things like hey let's for every accept call start a new thread","width":405},{"text":"and then everybody can talk to my server in parallel","width":387},{"text":"well that works until a thousand people try to connect and then you have a thousand threads that start on a machine with 8 CPUs that's probably going to work out so great","width":710},{"text":"so then we need to start figuring out even better ways to have a high performance server","width":368},{"text":"but anyways that's our four calls, socket, bind, listen and accept","width":240},{"text":"alright let's see this in action","width":300},{"text":"ooh look code!","width":192}],
// Part 5
[{"text":"Here we go! I'm going just hard code my, my constants. Like I said, we could have got this back from the address info.","width":764},{"text":"Today, I want to play with IP4, I want a TTP connection. There's my flags, those other flags you can set them here by bit-wise or-ing them.","width":591},{"text":"But we want a uh... a server, or passive connection. Yes, I remembered to set all my other unused fields to zero.","width":935},{"text":"Right. Yes, I'm going to call getaddrinfo. Check the result code; if it fails, I'll turn that into a useful error message.","width":610},{"text":"It's really really useful if your code doesn't work to actually check error messages by the way.","width":446},{"text":"Okay, so. We got a socket call, we got a bind let's connect to a local port.","width":460},{"text":"And look at this! I'm using the stuff I got from my getaddrinfo. I'm passing in that point of that struct and the size of that struct.","width":697},{"text":"okay, that's my set up: socket bind.","width":191},{"text":"Now, we start to say, \"Ooh!\" Um, please start listening and have a little backlog of ten connections.","width":583},{"text":"Okay. So, just for fun, I want to show you that I can say, \"I'm just doing a particular port. If I reach into one of these low-level C structures, I better remember to reverse the right order to turn it into from network to host (ntohs) and use the result of that call.","width":1955},{"text":"And now we're going to have our little server.","width":362},{"text":"This server code didn't actually send anything back to the client. It just listens to hear what the client has got to say.","width":438},{"text":"How do we do that? We call accept. Later on if we wanted to have to fill in the structure, like where the client was connecting from. We wanted their own IP address we can fill out these structures here.","width":923},{"text":"And remember how I said accept returns a new client? Here it is! Here is a new file descriptor (fd), and I'm going to use that on my read call and then turn it into a C string and print out what they said. Okay","width":1098},{"text":"So, let's uh, let's run this.","width":812},{"text":"Hmm. *bzzzzzzzzzzzz* Okie dokie, alright, so there's no error checking in this last part, um, alright.","width":515},{"text":"So I can... clear this right gcc ./server1 (./server1.c). Okay! Alright","width":1337},{"text":"Oh, look at that! That's my OSX is saying do you want to accept it?","width":329},{"text":"Wait! And it chose file descriptor 3, is this your port 1234? Shall we connect to it?","width":616},{"text":"Okay, alright. So, let's do this um, now I could write some C code, but instead I want to show you a pretty useful tool. It's called netcat.","width":1021},{"text":"Here is netcat. Blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah. Look it's like cat, except you can connect to an arbitrary machine, using an arbitrary protocol.","width":891},{"text":"And anything we sent this, it will use standard in and standard out.","width":546},{"text":"So today, I want to connect to 127.0.0.1, my local host, and I want to connect to port 1234.","width":1168},{"text":"So our code is working! The accept call has returned. ","width":192},{"text":"And it has given back our new file descriptor. Right, should we send something to it! Yes, okay here we go. HELLO GET / HTTP/1928349q87eyfaiu7tbeiqvwfa SAfuigae","width":831},{"text":"And here we go. So, it got that from the socket and printed that and stopped.","width":597},{"text":"This is the most useless web server in the world because it accepts one request then quits.","width":539},{"text":"Very easy to make a denial of service (DOS) on this particular web server. So what we'll do is make it so it cannot accept multiple clients. We're not going to do any threading code in this (we could though!). Right as soon as accept returns, why don't we make a new thread and pass it on.","width":992},{"text":"Instead, we'll just put this little part inside a loop. Alright so a while there.","width":913},{"text":"Okay, so we put this accept call inside a loop","width":1773},{"text":"Make another connection, and so on and so on. So we got the basics now of a little web server. What we have to do now is figure out how we are going to pause this. what do we want to do with this information, and what do we want to send back to the client?","width":1271},{"text":"Alright, so in fact what we've made is something a bit like a honey pot. For example, here's why it's called a honey pot.Take a jar of honey, open it, and see what insects are there after a minute or an hour. We can do this with our server. We can get it to simply listen on a particular port and see who connects and say capture the IP address. Or we can pretend to masquarade to build a real machine. Oh look! people are trying to log into this let's see what kind of pass","width":2502},{"text":"let's see what password they typed in.","width":223},{"text":"We can see what kind of attacks they do to our machines.","width":283},{"text":"So, on many modern networks now we have these machines which appear to be real machines, but which are infact are simple honey pots.","width":556},{"text":"This is the simplest kind, right? Where we can simply log the connection attempts, who they're from, and what information is sent to us.","width":704}],
// Part 6
[{"text":"Alright, another thing we're going to finish today is epoll.","width":558},{"text":"So I suggest for a simple server, hey, just uh, just little while loop.","width":296},{"text":"The next simple server is: hey make a thread so at least we can do this with uh multiple threads so that I can be servicing two clients at the same time.threads so","width":751},{"text":"Well, these kinds of ideas work until now you have hundreds or thousands of clients connected to it at the same time.","width":513},{"text":"And um, a bit of history is that we used to have a core called \"select\" you'll find in everywhere (works in a mac), but these days, epoll is a common solution to a hyperbolic server; in fact, you'll get to play with that this section.","width":1153},{"text":"And what epoll will ask you to do is with sockets or pipes, and you'll get to play with pipes.","width":455},{"text":"You can say, \"Actually, there's a whole load of file descriptors that I'm interested in.\"","width":338},{"text":"And so, the basic outline of epoll is: you make, we make a set you'll create, and then, using a control function we add a whole load of file descriptors, a whole load of file descriptors.","width":1541},{"text":"You say you'd want to read or write to these. What's your intent?","width":836},{"text":"And then you can wait--wait for an event.","width":477},{"text":"That's the basic idea.","width":126},{"text":"So actually now, I can have a single thread waiting on a thousand clients.","width":375},{"text":"If my clients don't talk to me very much, when one of them does, I can immediately find out which one.","width":500},{"text":"...because epoll call will tell me, \"Hey! By the way, now you have to talk to this particular file descriptor, now you need to be talking to this particular file descriptor.\"","width":502},{"text":"The old way of using select: will select allow me to go to sleep once something is happening; but once select returns, I'd have to kind of go through every single file descriptor. I'd have to do a linear search to find out which file descriptor was the one that I need to process.","width":1348},{"text":"So, that would be in session this week with epoll, and the other section thing we hope to do with sections tomorrow is to connect some class 7 code on the tablets as well.","width":877},{"text":"With that, have a wonderful week! Good luck with the MPs! I'll see you on Friday <3","width":384}],

any quick questions?","width":251.18181824684143},{"text":"okay right let's jump into some other kind of little bits of know how then","width":488.18181824684143},{"text":"so we've been making servers that listen on a particular port","width":299.18181824684143},{"text":"if you're just doing development, you may not care which port your server listens on","width":544.1818182468414},{"text":"you'll just say hey give me any port that's currently unused","width":233.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we can do this","width":103.18181824684143},{"text":"first of all when you call getaddressinfo if we're setting up a server, obviously we want to talk about localhost, that's NULL","width":365.18181824684143},{"text":"and just say I want port zero which is another way to say hey I'll be happy with any port","width":393.18181824684143},{"text":"well now we've got a problem though, we need to find out which port number we're actually listening on","width":482.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we do this, there's something called getsockname","width":372.18181824684143},{"text":"sock of course stands for socket","width":154.18181824684143},{"text":"as opposed to things you wear on your feat","width":318.18181824684143},{"text":"this code kind of looks a little bit like the code you might have been writing before getaddressinfo existed","width":414.18181824684143},{"text":"we have these different structs for example...","width":253.18181824684143},{"text":"there's this sockaddr in which you can think of as a version or as a subclass of this other struct","width":846.1818182468414},{"text":"but because C doesn't support [something] we can't say hey this extends this other struct","width":510.18181824684143},{"text":"we have to forcibly typecast it","width":234.18181824684143},{"text":"and so there's all sorts of interesting gotchas, any days that you forcibly type stuff you might forget for example to put in the ampersand here","width":531.1818182468414},{"text":"so there's all sorts of gotchas","width":302.18181824684143},{"text":"I'm not going to ask this on an exam, I'm just pointing out, if you want to develop code that listens on any port, this is the way to do it","width":590.1818182468414},{"text":"you call getsockname on your socket","width":253.18181824684143},{"text":"and now we from that struct we can figure out which port","width":325.18181824684143},{"text":"there's just one little gotcha here","width":157.18181824684143},{"text":"if we try to use this value directly.. hahaha","width":255.18181824684143},{"text":"oooooooh we're going to be in a world of pain","width":268.18181824684143},{"text":"why?","width":205.18181824684143}],

structures to do with hey the bytes that we're trying to send to the network card","width":468.18181824684143},{"text":"the port number that is represented inside this struct is not really an integer like we like to think of it like an integer that's on our CPU","width":675.1818182468414},{"text":"so if we actually want the value of this entry, we've got to convert it","width":384.18181824684143},{"text":"so don't forget to call...","width":321.18181824684143},{"text":"network to host short ntohs","width":360.18181824684143},{"text":"and that will give us back an integer value that is actually the integer of the port","width":395.18181824684143},{"text":"so next time you hate your lab partner, just walk over and delete that code and watch them try to connect to the wrong port for the rest of the discussion section","width":650.1818182468414},{"text":"right so that's a little gotcha there, no one will tell you that you've forgotten to convert your integer to the right value","width":354.18181824684143},{"text":"other than the fact that you'll be trying to connect to the incorrect port","width":320.18181824684143},{"text":"the other thing you might want to do is find out who is connecting to your server","width":225.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we can do that, remember this accept call, the thing that blocks waiting for a client to connect","width":493.18181824684143},{"text":"remember how it gives us back a new file descriptor?","width":281.18181824684143},{"text":"well we can now pass in a pointer to a struct","width":398.18181824684143},{"text":"very similar code here","width":113.18181824684143},{"text":"hey I've got this C structure, please fill it in and if you do that, it will tell you information about the remote client","width":541.1818182468414},{"text":"it won't tell you their login name but we can find out things like their IP address","width":324.18181824684143},{"text":"and their port number","width":77.18181824684143},{"text":"so for example, if you didn't like the remote client, why don't you send a thousand packets back to them and try and shut down their machine and send them a denial of service","width":525.1818182468414},{"text":"no don't do that for real unless you happen to be the US government","width":325.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so we've got that information and we now want to print something out","width":284.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we can do it","width":87.18181824684143},{"text":"you can say okay turn this number to an ASCII value","width":364.18181824684143},{"text":"and that will turn it into an IP4 address like 127.0.0.1 we can see that","width":463.18181824684143},{"text":"and also with the port number, oh look here we go again, don't forget to convert that struct entry into a real number","width":478.18181824684143},{"text":"and then we'll print it out","width":74.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so let's see that as a demo","width":461.18181824684143},{"text":"okie dokie","width":166.18181824684143},{"text":"so I'll go to server2 let's see if this works okay right","width":683.1818182468414},{"text":"right so I've got my code now, it just picks an arbitrary port number that is available","width":530.1818182468414},{"text":"and let me try connecting to that","width":266.18181824684143},{"text":"well actually why don't you see if you can connect to that","width":177.18181824684143},{"text":"if anyone's got their laptop open you can telnet to 172.17.248.187","width":478.18181824684143},{"text":"and see if someone connects to that port number","width":473.18181824684143},{"text":"okay fantastic right","width":215.18181824684143},{"text":"and I got your address so now I can telnet back to you for

today","width":289.18181824684143},{"text":"alright so that's in what you need for the next MP","width":252.18181824684143},{"text":"and to make your next multibillion dollar startup

this is a problem of just how efficient can we be?","width":428.18181824684143},{"text":"can we use our CPU resources and other system resources to get as much work done as possible?","width":700.1818182468414},{"text":"well it turns out of course that earliest deadline first isn't actually the most efficient algorithm","width":374.18181824684143},{"text":"because we might spend a lot of time flipping from one piece of work to another piece of work","width":390.18181824684143},{"text":"and so we actually have addition latency involved with these context switches","width":493.18181824684143},{"text":"and with scheduling all of this work","width":183.18181824684143},{"text":"so for example, if you find yourself constantly updating your calendar to say oh I'm going to do this work here and this work here","width":337.18181824684143},{"text":"you've chosen an inefficient scheduling algorithm","width":287.18181824684143}],

packets truly work","width":526},{"text":"You might be able to get it to work on your local subnet","width":287},{"text":"On your local router","width":124},{"text":"If you buy some very modern hardware","width":152},{"text":"But these days currently ","width":100},{"text":"UDP in practice","width":117},{"text":"Yes that's about the maximum size you send a packet","width":177},{"text":"So where is UDP actually used?","width":406},{"text":"You will see UDP packets for DNS","width":336},{"text":"domain name service","width":120},{"text":"So when you type in something like HEY","width":141},{"text":"I want to go to the host which say its bbc.com","width":305},{"text":"Somebody somewhere needs to know how to translate this address to an IPv4 or IPv6 address","width":748},{"text":"And the person","width":56},{"text":"The service","width":63},{"text":"Who knows how to do this is DNS","width":317},{"text":"Which cached this information","width":93},{"text":"So there's a whole hierarchical structure of servers that can convert hostnames and addresses to their relevant IP numbers","width":771},{"text":"To do this your machine sends out UDP packets","width":303},{"text":"And it may send out to 2 or 3 different DNS servers","width":318},{"text":"They might say Hey Im in a rush here","width":156},{"text":"And quick I need to know","width":68},{"text":"Who has the answer?","width":125},{"text":"So that's why we use DNS","width":87},{"text":"A single packet, if it gets lost, it doesn't matter","width":143},{"text":"I'm going to ask someone else as well","width":122},{"text":"If it times out I'll just send it again","width":136},{"text":"It's a simple kind of QUICK I NEED THIS","width":141},{"text":"and hopefully I'll get the response back as fast as possible","width":163},{"text":"Much faster than opening up a TCP connection","width":316},{"text":"So DNS traffic uses UDP","width":723},{"text":"Let's compare this with TCP","width":677},{"text":"So the TCP packets are much more uh complicated","width":440},{"text":"Here they are","width":37},{"text":"There's some similarities","width":227},{"text":"You'll notice that we've got a port number","width":310},{"text":"From the source and the destination","width":154},{"text":"Why do you think we need the source port?","width":695},{"text":"I'm sending you a packet to your server","width":194},{"text":"Why should I send you my source port?","width":268},{"text":"So you can respond","width":152},{"text":"So look there's multiple packets going out of different ports on my server all of the time","width":359},{"text":"When the other socket at the other end wants to send back some information it needs to know which port to send it to","width":520},{"text":"So  the source port is important because we'll need that for the destination","width":446},{"text":"We've also got a sequence number.","width":299},{"text":"Remember","width":39},{"text":"What does TCP try to do ?","width":67},{"text":"It tries to hide the fact that we're sending packets across","width":175},{"text":"We've kind of turned this into a stream","width":133},{"text":"But packets might get lost","width":64},{"text":"It might get duplicated","width":171},{"text":"So our trick is to keep track of the total number of bytes that we've successively sent in each direction","width":538},{"text":"So we'll mark each packet with where we are in the stream","width":399},{"text":"So we have a sequence number","width":85},{"text":"It represents the actual number of bytes that have been transferred in this direction so far","width":359},{"text":"So this means if we lose some packets","width":159},{"text":"The other end can say","width":144},{"text":"HEY","width":28},{"text":"I lost you. I lost you at this point","width":173},{"text":"","width":3},{"text":"Can you resend starting from here?","width":329},{"text":"And that's part of the acknowledgement number","width":124},{"text":"The other end of our connection can say I hear you","width":277},{"text":"I've got your message so far up to this point in the stream","width":681},{"text":"Right","width":192}],

uh","width":172},{"text":"Right so so check the return value of stat","width":487},{"text":"Now I mentioned before you can do fdopen","width":414},{"text":"and uh fdopen allows you to go from a file

link","width":106},{"text":"is a file that pretends it doesn't exist","width":243},{"text":"instead it says HAH I don't exist, what you're actually looking for is","width":283},{"text":"over here

happens","width":318.18181824684143},{"text":"until a change happens, and that way, we can use our resources efficiently","width":504.18181824684143},{"text":"right lets just see what you remember from previous lectures","width":177.18181824684143},{"text":"what's realloc","width":367.18181824684143},{"text":"it's when you change your mind","width":90.18181824684143},{"text":"you say, oh okay remember those bytes i malloc, actually i decided i need more bytes","width":393.18181824684143},{"text":"so we can use realloc when i say i'm creating an array","width":292.18181824684143},{"text":"and i keep going around a loop","width":93.18181824684143},{"text":"and i decide to say remember that array i made","width":125.18181824684143},{"text":"turns out it's not large enough","width":152.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so realloc works but there's a big caveat","width":355.18181824684143},{"text":"as you've just seen how malloc actually places things","width":210.18181824684143},{"text":"it could be that we can't keep the user data inside the same memory address anymore","width":356.18181824684143},{"text":"so when you call realloc be prepared to update your pointers with the return result of realloc","width":465.18181824684143},{"text":"so if i've got an array","width":153.18181824684143},{"text":"that i previously created say from realloc or malloc or calloc","width":457.18181824684143},{"text":"then don't just say you know what im gonna make it larger","width":786.1818182468414},{"text":"i'm gonna make it say 100x 100 entries larger","width":476.18181824684143},{"text":"infact, let me just change this code a little bit","width":143.18181824684143},{"text":"let's say that ","width":206.18181824684143},{"text":"you called calloc","width":126.18181824684143},{"text":"and","width":126.18181824684143},{"text":"i've

[{"text":"so here's two gotchas the first is that my variable, array i didnt build it to update","width":820.1818182468414},{"text":"and so it could be that during testing everything is fine but later one it turns out that im trying to change the size of realloc and actually had to move my array to different memory and i didnt update it","width":812.1818182468414},{"text":"so make sure you use a

else","width":184.18181824684143},{"text":"this is a fantastic gotcha","width":367.18181824684143},{"text":"does that code really allocate enough things for 100

entries","width":696.1818182468414},{"text":"so don't just plug in N here or number of items remember that calloc realloc and malloc work with bytes","width":477.18181824684143},{"text":"and we didnt allocate enough bytes","width":139.18181824684143},{"text":"which means later on","width":74.18181824684143},{"text":"when we start putting things in our array we're going to go past the end of the

does calloc do","width":164.18181824684143},{"text":"okay it takes two arguments","width":140.18181824684143},{"text":"and it multiplies them together to determine the number of bytes","width":179.18181824684143},{"text":"what else? how is it different from malloc?","width":289.18181824684143},{"text":"it clears the memory","width":68.18181824684143},{"text":"yes","width":112.18181824684143},{"text":"calloc now only gives you back a pointer to some memory","width":194.18181824684143},{"text":"it zeros out all

much slower","width":83.18181824684143},{"text":"we actually have to write to all those memory locations","width":104.18181824684143},{"text":"and you remember talking to memory is really slow","width":187.18181824684143},{"text":"especially when you need to talk to lots of it","width":167.18181824684143},{"text":"so the reason that we dont necessarily always call calloc is because

first","width":498.18181824684143},{"text":"so it zeros the bytes","width":800.1818182468414},{"text":"so you can write a loop to do this","width":228.18181824684143},{"text":"but ill give you a

much","width":159.18181824684143},{"text":"but we have talked about indirectly","width":207.18181824684143},{"text":"the last lecture","width":78.18181824684143},{"text":"i gave you an idea about whenever we did an allocation","width":220.18181824684143},{"text":"we could actually store the size of our allocated area","width":463.18181824684143},{"text":"at the beginning and the end of each part","width":270.18181824684143},{"text":"so rather than having a separate struct like we saw at the beginning of this lecture","width":223.18181824684143},{"text":"we could actually hide inside here how many bytes this is","width":280.18181824684143},{"text":"so this say is 16 bytes","width":158.18181824684143},{"text":"put 16 here","width":71.18181824684143},{"text":"this is 20","width":212.18181824684143},{"text":"so if we do these tags at the beginning and end","width":272.18181824684143},{"text":"then when we come to do something like a free","width":359.18181824684143},{"text":"i know that because these are like train couches becuase theyre next door to each other if i just go backwards enough bytes","width":438.18181824684143},{"text":"i can actually read how big the previous allocation was","width":236.18181824684143},{"text":"and that allows me to manipulate these

these tags which are next to each other","width":369.18181824684143},{"text":"alright","width":55.18181824684143},{"text":"so when actually return from malloc","width":193.18181824684143},{"text":"we wouldn't return the beginning of the carriage if you like, no we look a few bytes in","width":383.18181824684143},{"text":"and say okay here's that area for you to play with","width":240.18181824684143},{"text":"you can put whatever data you want inside this bit here","width":246.18181824684143},{"text":"because you asked for 8 bytes in the middle","width":258.18181824684143},{"text":"but becuase the users code was broken","width":296.18181824684143},{"text":"it kept going","width":140.18181824684143},{"text":"say someone didn't actually request enough bytes","width":238.18181824684143},{"text":"so as a result of that","width":101.18181824684143},{"text":"the user code just destroyed our metainformation inside here","width":329.18181824684143},{"text":"in fact it could've kept going as well","width":527.1818182468414},{"text":"things might seem to work until the day the code calls free","width":446.18181824684143},{"text":"becuase now you're free implementation assumes that it can read these values correctly","width":417.18181824684143},{"text":"but as we've just seen the values here are gone","width":473.18181824684143},{"text":"they've been replaced by whatever the user code happened to write in there or the rest of the program actually did","width":467.18181824684143},{"text":"so now you linked list manipulation and your calculations","width":267.18181824684143},{"text":"ha ha ha","width":240.18181824684143},{"text":"might be updating arbitrary pieces of memory","width":144.18181824684143},{"text":"and you're adding whatever the values were in here","width":255.18181824684143},{"text":"heres an example where a buffer overflow could make your perfectly reasonable code do bad things","width":478.18181824684143},{"text":"now it could make it say write arbitrary values into arbitrary different locations","width":339.18181824684143},{"text":"which is why buffer overflows are so dangerous","width":275.18181824684143},{"text":"of course most likely whats going to happen is when you call free your program crashes","width":385.18181824684143},{"text":"so when your program crashes during free its probably because something bad happened earlier to the heap","width":546.1818182468414},{"text":"so how can we stop that?","width":229.18181824684143},{"text":"what can we do?","width":364.18181824684143},{"text":"lets say youve inherited a program where it just crashes strangely on free","width":350.18181824684143},{"text":"how could you try to figure out what's going on?","width":693.1818182468414}],
