I just showed you one with %d's","width":581},{"text":"and it is until it isn't","width":209},{"text":"it's actually subtly different, so the day that you actually need to write a scanf, open up the manpage and check the format specifiers because it's not quite the same","width":635},{"text":"for example floating points are slightly different","width":177},{"text":"so that's the kind of first gotcha. that second gotcha I've just shown you, which is that the number of items that you've read isn't necessarily all of them, so you should check that","width":819},{"text":"and then the third gotcha is guess what, we can put in addresses here and sometimes you want to put in an ampersand and sometimes you don't","width":722},{"text":"so I showed you one way we did ampersand y ampersand z because I actually wanted to know the address of my integer variables","width":904},{"text":"can you think of a time when you might not actually want to put in the ampersand?","width":492},{"text":"yeah, if you already have a pointer to the thing that you want to change","width":359},{"text":"so if you've got a pointer to an integer variable, there we go, let's put in pointer here and provided that pointer is pointing to something a variable I want to change, everything is fine","width":1612},{"text":"everything is not fine if I was to write in ampersand pointer","width":522},{"text":"because now what am I changing?","width":333},{"text":"I'm changing this, I'm not changing the thing its pointing to","width":383},{"text":"and if you think this is complicated or confusing, it is!","width":245},{"text":"so my advice is don't write scanf code until you've had three cups of coffee, you're completely awake and it's the most important thing in the world to get it right","width":470},{"text":"and even then, assume that you've got it wrong","width":211},{"text":"scanf code is incredibly hard to write correctly and you can get nasty little errors just by missing an ampersand or putting an ampersand when you don't need one","width":525},{"text":"scanf is not going to detect that, you have to be extremely clear about whether you mean to talk about the thing, the address of the thing or using the thing that the thing is pointing to","width":732},{"text":"so it's not for the feint hearted","width":118},{"text":"and with that warning, let's carry on","width":323},{"text":"I can promise you I've spent hours debugging scanf code","width":249},{"text":"that I thought was correct","width":209},{"text":"here's some other things that will kill us or get you","width":201},{"text":"gets is easy to use, you just say gets and you give it a pointer to your buffer","width":718},{"text":"to some characters","width":460},{"text":"description, never use this function","width":238},{"text":"the reason I bring it up is because people like to ask about it occasionally in exams and occasionally in interviews","width":356},{"text":"it's a classic example of how to hack a program, hack a C program because gets like strcpy has no idea how big this buffer is","width":781},{"text":"how many bytes it can safetly write into whatever address you give it","width":377},{"text":"so if the data that it's reading from stdin happens to be bigger than your buffer, arbitrary things can happen","width":431},{"text":"now someone could use this to supply data that is longer than your buffer and start overwriting arbitrary memory locations","width":433},{"text":"and those arbitrary memory locations probably correspond to other variables","width":283},{"text":"so now someone can use your program to do bad things, to do things that the program is not designed to do","width":490},{"text":"so how do we fix this?
