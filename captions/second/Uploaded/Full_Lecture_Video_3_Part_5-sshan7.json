I've got three different versions","width":319},{"text":"and also do you notice any errors?

I'll walk around in case anyone's got any questions","width":18098},{"text":"ok, so, that assert() call at the beginning. the nice thing about assert() in production code it disappears, there's no performance overhead. it's not even evalutated","width":693},{"text":"the macro compiles to nothing, so the purpose of this is during debugging I want to catch early if someone gives me a bad pointer","width":585},{"text":"right, so if we say character result, then anytime we use the variable result in the future it will point to the beginning of the array ","width":432},{"text":"sounds great, we can use up to 256 bytes, in other words a string with 256 pics, 255 letters and a 0 byte at the end which fits","width":490},{"text":"however, this is an automatic variable stored on the stack, which means it's scope is only for the length of this function","width":627},{"text":"and, if we try to store anything in here, that's ok, but it becomes meaningless after the function returns","width":537},{"text":"so, yes, we can return a pointer to this array, but don't expect that memory to be valid after the function returns","width":444},{"text":"so, that's no good. we need memory that's going to exist for longer than that","width":307},{"text":"so we turn to malloc() to say 'hey give me some memory on the heap please'","width":239}]
