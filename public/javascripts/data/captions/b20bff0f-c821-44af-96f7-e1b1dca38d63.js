  [{"text":"which is, if you think about it, a pretty good definition of what learning is.","width":402},{"text":"And I wanna emphasize one thing here, 'drawn from the sample population'.","width":277},{"text":"This is actually the key.","width":124},{"text":"If you haven't thought about it yet, think about it, and you will have to think about it in the course of this semester.","width":349},{"text":"Because this is one key starting point for us, as computer scientists, to think about this problem, if we wanna think about machine learning in any formal way.","width":760},{"text":"So that we can write programs.","width":142},{"text":"So that we can analyze programs.","width":126},{"text":"So that we can say something about the performance of a machine learning program.","width":297},{"text":"Can we say whether it's gonna do well on previously unseen examples?","width":296},{"text":"Can we say something about how well ti's gonna do?","width":223},{"text":"Can we give some guarantees on performance, which is the job we have as computer scientists?","width":446},{"text":"It all hinges on this part of this statement, 'drawn from the same population'.","width":372},{"text":"If we don't make this kind of assumptions, or similar assumptions, there's nothing we can do.","width":430},{"text":"And this is gonna be a core component of what we are gonna do in this class.","width":264},{"text":"We're gonna try to think about why does it work, or when does it work, and when it doesn't.","width":393},{"text":"So I wanna actually augment the definition and I wanna think about machine learning mostly as the ability to perform a task in a situation which has never been encountered before.","width":840},{"text":"So to me, learning is really generalization, or abstraction if you want.","width":256},{"text":"If you think about it, all the examples that I've given before were example that for vast majority of you were new.","width":535},{"text":"Nevertheless, it didn't bothered you.","width":125},{"text":"You could do the prediction quite easily.","width":166},{"text":"In fact, almost any situation that you encounter in life at the very fine level of representation, it's new.","width":612},{"text":"When you are listening to what I'm saying now, behind my fine accent, you have no problem of understanding it even though it's a new signal for you.","width":730},{"text":"When you look around, every time yo see a completely different image, nevertheless, you can interpret it.","width":531},{"text":"So the key question is how do you do the subtraction.","width":291},{"text":"This is really what machine learning is about, so don't lose track of it even though we're gonna force you to lose track of it because it's gonna be more technical, but this is really what we are aiming at.","width":762},{"text":"To figure out how to generalize.","width":248},{"text":"And again, you can think about the spam filter, whenever you see a spam message, you know it's spam even though you've never seen it before.","width":775},{"text":"And you won't just, in this case, do the simple thing- decide yes or no in this case.","width":432},{"text":"So this learner able or at least attempts to classify items it has never seen before.","width":600},{"text":"And you gave a lot of ideas on what does it mean that it is able to do it.","width":323},{"text":"And what should we look at in this representation, and this is the key.","width":317},{"text":"In what sense is this message similar to others and different from others that you have seen before.","width":538},{"text":"And if you are able to figure out this representational issues, then you have a chance of writing a program that will predict correctly on this.","width":976},{"text":"If you wanna think about learning as generalization, you can dream up a lot of examples and I'm just gonna run through this example very quickly, it happens everywhere.","width":633},{"text":"Classification problem like medical diagnosis.","width":194},{"text":"Credit card applications, that for years already, are using machine learning technology.","width":366},{"text":"Or recognizing hand writing letters.","width":184},{"text":"And many other things.","width":112},{"text":"You can see it in other more involved scenarios, like planning and acting, navigation, self-driving cars, game-playing.","width":617},{"text":"You can see it in skills, how to balance a ball, how to play tennis.","width":345},{"text":"These are all learning activities that rely on the ability to generalize from previous situation to future unseen situations.","width":1009},{"text":"And, of course, common sense reasoning, whatever that means, for example things that dictate natural language interactions, scene interpretations, and other things.","width":766},{"text":"So really I wanna highlight the underlying all these abilities is really the basic ability to perform a task in a situation which has never been encountered before.","width":1024},{"text":"And while this class is about algorithms, so we are gonna talk a lot about machine learning algorithms, I want you to keep thinking about this notion of representation that is as important and as crucial to the ability of machine learning programs to work as the algorithm.","width":1502},{"text":"And in fact, perhaps even more important.","width":167},{"text":"That does not mean that we are gonna spend more time on representation than on algorithms, the reason is that we have less to say about representation than on algorithms.","width":734},{"text":"But it's really a crucial thing.","width":195},{"text":"So why do we wanna study learning?","width":169},{"text":"A lot of opportunities.","width":264}],

one, or 'whether' type two, whatever it is here, I just put brackets around it, so it will be easy for the feature extraction program to do the extraction.","width":1212},{"text":"So that's the data.","width":108},{"text":"Now what do we do with this data?","width":207},{"text":"We use features.","width":177},{"text":"So these are feature definitions.","width":135},{"text":"And let me say something about it.","width":122},{"text":"So the language here is something like this.","width":278},{"text":"So, the features that we use are words, and part of speech tagging.","width":447},{"text":"And then we use the location also.","width":152},{"text":"When we sit on a word, 'weather' type one, say, we look up to two to the left, up to two to the right, and we record what the word is there, and what is the part of speech.","width":849},{"text":"For example, this feature says that one means one to the right of the target word is the word 'that'.","width":617},{"text":"This feature says that the part of speech to the right, this is the one, is a terminal.","width":459},{"text":"This feature says that to the left, minus one, the part of speech tagging just before the target word is a punctuation, and so on.","width":597},{"text":"So minus one says go to the left, one or two say go to the right.","width":389},{"text":"And then we write either p or w to represent the part of speech tag or word.","width":264},{"text":"Now you can see that some of these words are conjunctions.","width":285},{"text":"For example, the word just before is a preposition, the part of speech just before is a preposition, and the part of speech just after is a pronoun.","width":803},{"text":"So that's a conjunction, right?","width":124},{"text":"I already knew that just taking the features, as I said: location, part of speech or word, is not gonna be enough, and so I took conjunctions of size two.","width":708},{"text":"In fact, I think if you go down the list, you will see also conjunction of size three of this.","width":394},{"text":"So, the space, if I were just taking the individual features, it wouldn't work.","width":442},{"text":"Because we take conjunctions, it's actually...","width":173},{"text":"a linear function can do it.","width":87},{"text":"So [mumble], these are a list of features.","width":315},{"text":"The numbers that you see beyond that are really not important for you.","width":268},{"text":"I mean, these are just some statistics that I've taken over the features.","width":211},{"text":"For example, the last two numbers indicate whether this feature was active in the present, 'weather' type one, or how many times this feature was active in the 'weather' type one example, and 'whether' type two example.","width":879},{"text":"And you can see that it's actually quite one-sided on the top features here.","width":378},{"text":"You can guess which is 'weather' type one, and 'whether' type two here.","width":328},{"text":"And this number is just a statistic over the feature.","width":223},{"text":"It's a chai squared statistic.","width":80},{"text":"It really doesn't matter.","width":84},{"text":"It's just used to, in this case, sort the features by expected importance, or something like this.","width":492},{"text":"So that's what you get.","width":130},{"text":"So these are really the same type of example that I just showed, right?","width":218},{"text":"So it's conjunctive features over the inputs that we have.","width":346},{"text":"And the final thing I wanna show is, these are the examples.","width":447},{"text":"Right, so now every sentence becomes a list of active features.","width":513},{"text":"So each feature got a name, got a number- was hashed into a number- the first is actually the label in this.","width":567},{"text":"So you can see that the labels are either one or zero.","width":275},{"text":"These are the two types.","width":121},{"text":"And the rest are features, And one important thing to see is that these are variable size examples.","width":558},{"text":"Not every sentence is gonna be encoded into the same number of features.","width":388},{"text":"And you can see also that the numbers become quite large.","width":183},{"text":"They are going to be eventually thousands of features.","width":259},{"text":"Only very few of them are active in each example.","width":179},{"text":"So that means that computationally, you may want to think carefully about how you represent them.","width":452},{"text":"Questions on this?","width":291},{"text":"So is that clear?","width":43},{"text":"That's the learning problem.","width":69},{"text":"That's really the learning problem.","width":98},{"text":"We started with data, we invented features, our features are conjunctions of primitive features, and then we took each sentence, and coded it.","width":958},{"text":"And this is each line, each row here is one example.","width":490},{"text":"Questions?","width":100},{"text":"Yeah?","width":107},{"text":"[student asks question, inaudible] .", "width":401}],
  [{"text":"And I'm not gonna prove it, I can give some pointers to where this is shown, but for now, what we're gonna do is we're gonna say, 'okay, we cannot do this, let's simplify the problem.' Instead of minimizing what we really want to minimize, which is the [mumble] number of mistakes, we're gonna invent another loss function that will be an upper bound to the real loss function that we care about, and try to minimize that.","width":1992},{"text":"So, we're gonna move from this nice, discrete problem, loss function that we care about, to something that is related to it.","width":661},{"text":"And typically we're gonna [mumble] try to move to a convex upper bound of the true loss function, and the reason is that computationally, it's gonna be easier to minimize.","width":710},{"text":"Okay, so what are we gonna do?","width":102},{"text":"So, our loss function that measures the penalty that we incur (that the classifier incurs on an example) is gonna be replaced now by some surrogates.","width":834},{"text":"As I said, we start with this, the loss function is zero if we got it right (lost nothing), and one, if we made a mistake, and we're gonna replace it, for example, with this loss function: square loss.","width":1028},{"text":"Again, if f(x)=y, the loss is zero, but if f(x) is not equal to y, we lose something.","width":651},{"text":"And we lose as a function of how far f(x) is from y.","width":234},{"text":"You can invent other loss functions.","width":116},{"text":"So this is this loss function, where the x-axis is f(x)-y, right?","width":393},{"text":"But you can invent others, you can say, 'lets define an input dependent loss'.","width":297},{"text":"So, it's gonna be zero if we are okay, and some f(x) otherwise.","width":423},{"text":"So typically, we wanna move to a continuous convex function, because this is easy to optimize, and here are some common examples that people are using.","width":832},{"text":"I'm not gonna give all the details, but look at it carefully later on.","width":200},{"text":"The function that we mentioned before is this black curve, here.","width":582},{"text":"It's this function, 0-1 Loss, it's called.","width":249},{"text":"Now, everything in this graph, or most of the things in this graph, I'm writing in terms of the product, y*f(x).","width":502},{"text":"Now y*f(x), think about it, y could be+/- 1, f(x) could be any real value.","width":562},{"text":"If f(x) is positive, we assume it's a positive example.","width":263},{"text":"If f(x) is negative, we assume it's a negative example.","width":204},{"text":"So this product, y*f(x), is important to us because if it's positive, it means that the sign of y and f(x) agree; either both of them are positive, we are happy, or both of them are negative, we are also happy.","width":1014},{"text":"So sign(y*f(x)) is an indication of whether we are on the right side, or not.","width":564},{"text":"If the signs of y and f(x) are different, it means that y*f(x) is negative, then the sign is gonna be negative one.","width":541},{"text":"You can check the 0-1 loss here, sign(y*f(x)), if it's one, is gonna be zero.","width":541},{"text":"We're happy?","width":129},{"text":"If they differ, then it's gonna be minus one.","width":261},{"text":"And this is why I put the half here, so that at the end, we will get just 1.","width":263},{"text":"So we get this step function here.","width":274},{"text":"And these other loss functions are also important.","width":178},{"text":"The square loss is here at the bottom, it is the green curve.","width":266},{"text":"I just shifted it by one.","width":184},{"text":"This is the x-axis here.","width":135},{"text":"In all cases, it's y*f(x), except for this square loss.","width":403},{"text":"And another important loss function, for example, is this exponential loss: the red curve here.","width":535}],

  [{"text":"Okay so, so we ended last time quickly by talking about a few issues, right?","width":462},{"text":"So we talked about stochastic-- we talked about two algorithms: stochastic gradient descent, or online gradient descent, and gradient descent umm, and and I wanted to make a few comments, first of all in terms of um computational issues.","width":1279},{"text":"I quickly ran through this.","width":156},{"text":"It's really an important question, that you want to get some understanding to.","width":408},{"text":"How long would it take you to learn?","width":82},{"text":"How many examples do you need to see, so that you know well, what I've learned from this training data is going to do well in the future.","width":685},{"text":"And we're going to get to it a little bit later in the semester, but its important to realize that, uhh, this is one way to ask the question.","width":481},{"text":"Right?","width":11},{"text":"So you know that what I'm going to learn from my training data is not going to be exact.","width":284},{"text":"We already discussed this and gave a few examples.","width":182},{"text":"So you can ask the question of umm, I just want to ensure that what I've learned, the linear threshold unit has an error rate of less than epsilon, with high probability.","width":1005},{"text":"So with high probability, I'm not going to make a lot of mistakes.","width":390},{"text":"How many examples do I need to see to guarantee this?","width":171},{"text":"And it turns out that it's not that many, its actually linear in the dimension.","width":418},{"text":"As you can see, and inversely proportional to linear in epsilon, and log one over delta.","width":392},{"text":"Which if you think about it, it's not so bad, we're going to talk about it a little bit later.","width":265},{"text":"And we're going to actually prove something like this.","width":170},{"text":"So that's one important question, the second important question is that of computational complexity.","width":327},{"text":"I already told you that if you have just any data, and you want to learn a linear classifier that minimizes the number of mistakes, that is, that minimizes the number of pluses that happen to be classified on the minus side, plus the number of minuses that happen to be classified as pluses, that's NP-hard.","width":1561},{"text":"However, if I tell you ahead of time, this data is linearly separable, it turns out that the algorithm, an algorithm that finds the linear uhh separator, that's a polynomial time algorithm.","width":982},{"text":"And the proof for that in fact you're going to give in your homework one when you show that it's possible to formulate it as a linear program.","width":667},{"text":"Okay?","width":19},{"text":"Is it clear that what you're doing is showing that the algorithm is polynomial?","width":375},{"text":"Because we know that there is a polynomial time algorithm for linear programming.","width":234},{"text":"Now the question that I was asked, so, why do I even bother to learn this stochastic gradient descent or many other online algorithms that we talk about?","width":538},{"text":"There is a closed form solution.","width":131},{"text":"Take all the data, put it in a matrix, and you can write down a solution.","width":617},{"text":"So why do I bother uhh, about algorithms?","width":475},{"text":"Why not just compute the inverse or the pseudo-inverse of this matrix that contains all the data?","width":341},{"text":"[student's answer] Why that's basically the answer.","width":509},{"text":"So I don't want to put all the data that I have in one matrix and invert it, maybe if I run an online algorithm, I won't even have to touch all the data.","width":929},{"text":"Uhh, there are a few other issues uhh, computational issues that have to do with these solutions.","width":462},{"text":"In fact even when you compute this inverse, really what you are doing is an iterative algorithm.","width":403},{"text":"So you are just hiding the iteration, the iterative computation, in another way.","width":384},{"text":"But these are important algorithms.","width":147},{"text":"So, we will also be able to say something about online algorithms in terms of how good are they, in terms of the difficulty of the data, which is something you cannot say, in an easy way at least, uhh if you don't think about it this way.","width":1008},{"text":"What we'll see is that uhh online algorithm have uhh generalization ability, let's say, that is quadratically inverse uhh to the margin.","width":928},{"text":"Which hand-wavingly how difficult the problem is, how far are the points that you want to separate from the best linear classifier that you can learn.","width":693},{"text":"Umm, okay.","width":119},{"text":"So, anyhow, we're going to talk about a lot more algorithms.","width":220},{"text":"Umm.","width":142},{"text":"All of them turns out to be one way or another algorithms for linear classifiers.","width":445},{"text":"There uhh algorithmically they look very differently, they have different guarantees, they work under different conditions, uhh different ways but all of them are linear algorithms which you should be okay with now, given what we said last time in terms of the expressivity.","width":1101},{"text":"Okay so, so I answered two of the three questions that I got last time, and the reason is that I don't remember the third question, uhh but if you still have this question, it's a good time now.","width":918},{"text":"Questions?","width":281}],
  [{"text":"for three, and represent the data this way.","width":395},{"text":"Alright, so for two, sixteen choose two cominations for three, about 560 numbers.","width":610},{"text":"And of course if n is a hundred, it becomes impossible to deal with.","width":525},{"text":"And this is only for three dimensional tables on a a hundred attributes, and of course if you want more, you can uh...","width":501},{"text":"So the question is that of data representation, at least one of it is data representation.","width":377},{"text":"How do we take data that have a lot off attributes, and represent it in a way that we can understand what's important, what are the the key attributes in this data, what's unimportant.","width":764},{"text":"So you need to figure out a way to represent it, and such a way that the important attributes pop up.","width":501},{"text":"And information theory is gonna be the tool that we are gonna use to do something like this.","width":379},{"text":"It's gonna be able to tell us something about how to representing in a way by surfacing up somehow the important attributes.","width":564},{"text":"An the decision tree is gonna be the tool to do it.","width":208},{"text":"So what are decision trees.","width":143},{"text":"It's a data structure, it's a hierarchical data structure that represents data by divide and conquer strategy.","width":499},{"text":"You can think about it from the learning perspective as an non-parametric classification method.","width":366},{"text":"It can also be a regression method.","width":132},{"text":"So we are only gonna talk about the case where you have categorical labels, but you can also think about decision trees essentially the same algorithm that produces read values, uh, numbers.","width":820},{"text":"And the idea is given a correction of an example we wanna be able to induce a decision tree that represents the data.","width":492},{"text":"For example here's the collection of shapes that I'll divide into three categories.","width":503},{"text":"And they have multiple attributes, the color, and the shape for example.","width":442},{"text":"True?","width":43},{"text":"And I could say if the color is red, the type is B.","width":473},{"text":"Simple decision.","width":75},{"text":"If the color is green, then I don't know, I need to look at something else, I need to look at the shape.","width":458},{"text":"So I'm gonna get something like this.","width":135},{"text":"So if the color is red, I know exactly it's type B.","width":218},{"text":"If the color is green, I still don't know, I have to look at the shapes.","width":183},{"text":"Circle is A, square is B.","width":183},{"text":"So that's the type of things.","width":124},{"text":"So what I have here is an decision tree of the two features, two attributes, color and shape.","width":578},{"text":"And then I have the label, which is one of A, B, or C.","width":260},{"text":"Nodes are tests for the feature values.","width":292},{"text":"And the leaves are the categories, the labels.","width":146},{"text":"So once I have this decision tree, evaluating it is very simple.","width":529},{"text":"I'm gonna give you a shape, and you will be able to quickly go down the tree and tell me whether it's type A, B, or C.","width":585},{"text":"Agreed?","width":149},{"text":"The difficulty is gonna be how to learn this decision tree.","width":299},{"text":"I'm gonna give you data, how to learn a good decision tree for this data?","width":343},{"text":"So again, think about this data here.","width":187},{"text":"And we induce somehow the decision tree.","width":202},{"text":"Seems somehow reasonable, at least correct.","width":157},{"text":"I don't know if who can do a better one.","width":143},{"text":"In fact, we haven't even talk about what does it mean to be a better decision tree.","width":446},{"text":"So before we get to learning, I wanna talk about expressivity.","width":266},{"text":"To simplify the discussion on expressivity, I changed the categories here to only be plus and minus.","width":379},{"text":"So it's a binary label, boolean function.","width":315},{"text":"So decision trees with pluses and minuses, the leaves are boolean functions.","width":451},{"text":"We talked about expressivity of boolean functions, so e talked about linear classifiers and said not all boolean functions can be written as linear functions.","width":737},{"text":"Not all boolean functions can be written as disjunctions.","width":236},{"text":"This is your homework.","width":75},{"text":"Some I'm at least understanding it as your homework assignment.","width":315},{"text":"What about decision trees?","width":81},{"text":"what can you say about the expressivity of decision trees.","width":354},{"text":"What kind of boolean functions can be expressed or cannot be expressed?","width":714},{"text":"So you have a bunch of features or attributes, or in this case, color and shape, and you wanna write a boolean function, something that maps.","width":915},{"text":"[Student mumbling] So each path is a conjunction, so the color is blue and the blue and the shape is a triangle that's negative example.","width":1004},{"text":"Or the color is green and the shape is square, positive example.","width":423},{"text":"So a path is a conjunction.","width":175},{"text":"But overall the decision

this, but I just want to mention that it exists.","width":280},{"text":"One issue is that sometimes you have attributes that have different importance- different costs.","width":470},{"text":"So some

again by the end of today.","width":676},{"text":"Okay, so.","width":130},{"text":"So what do I mean when I say quantifying performance.","width":145},{"text":"I want to be able to say something

see that this is quite general.","width":623},{"text":"We are going to talk about quantifying performance as a number of examples that we see before we can say something about the learned
