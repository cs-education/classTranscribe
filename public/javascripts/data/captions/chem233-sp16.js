the course.","width":213},{"text":"First, my name is Dr.","width":62},{"text":"Shawn Miller and I will be your instructor for Chem 233.","width":249},{"text":"Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this recorded webcast is merely a summary of course structure and policy as outlined in the course syllabus.","width":523},{"text":"You are expected to read the course syllabus in its entirety and be familiar with its contents.","width":337},{"text":"This webcast is not a substitute for reading the course syllabus.","width":267},{"text":"For course announcements, please regularly check the Compass 2g course website and Piazza.","width":292},{"text":"We will talk about what Piazza is in a little bit.","width":199},{"text":"I do not send mass emails on a regular basis.","width":148},{"text":"I prefer announcements because they are a permanent location where you can always view the information I would like you to see.","width":437},{"text":"Please make sure you read the syllabus and check announcements on a regular basis.","width":302},{"text":"If you miss something important and it is located in either of those two locations, that is unfortunate.","width":317},{"text":"It is your responsibility to ensure that you are up to date on course information via announcements and the course syllabus.","width":386},{"text":"I suggest that you check for new announcements every day.","width":190},{"text":"If there is an emergency and I need you to know something immediately, I will send an email then.","width":265},{"text":"Chem 233 has two main components.","width":246},{"text":"The first component consists of webcasts, like the one you are watching now, and the lecture periods.","width":372},{"text":"This component of the course is focused on theory and problem solving.","width":274},{"text":"Via the webcasts and lecture we will discuss experiment background information, tips for performing an experiment, and work through practice problems.","width":503},{"text":"The second component of this course is the laboratory component.","width":291},{"text":"The laboratory component is focused on practical application of what you have learned and critical thinking.","width":353},{"text":"In this component of the course, you will perform experiments, collect data, and then draw conclusions and support those conclusions using the data that you have collected.","width":567},{"text":"After you finish this course, what should you have gotten out of this?","width":173},{"text":"Well, by the end of this course you will be able to explain the theory behind standard organic chemistry techniques and instruments.","width":465},{"text":"You will be able to solve problems utilizing fundamental organic chemistry laboratory concepts.","width":439},{"text":"You will be able to predict the outcome of an experiment using knowledge of the theory behind an experiment.","width":344},{"text":"You will be able to execute basic organic chemistry laboratory procedures efficiently and safely.","width":303},{"text":"You will be able to record relevant scientific data and observations and finally, you will be able to draw conclusions supported by provided spectroscopic data or your own recorded laboratory data.","width":866},{"text":"Thats a lot of goals.","width":59},{"text":"How will you practice achieving these goals?","width":180},{"text":"You will practice achieving these goals by first, watching the recorded webcasts and actively participating in the discussion formatted lectures.","width":483},{"text":"Let's talk about these webcasts and these lectures.","width":214},{"text":"Every experiment will have one or more webcasts associated with it.","width":237},{"text":"You are responsible for watching those webcasts prior to coming to that lecture period associated with that webcast.","width":507},{"text":"These webcasts, like the one you are watching now, are viewable on the Compass 2g website and you can view them as many times as you wish.","width":464},{"text":"A typical webcast will present both the theoretical background information for a topic, as well as practical and safety considerations for the associated laboratory experiment.","width":542},{"text":"When watching these webcasts, it is highly recommended that you take notes like you would for any other lecture.","width":553},{"text":"You will find these notes useful when it comes time to say prepare for a post lab quiz or for an exam.","width":387},{"text":"If these webcasts are the primary method for communicating information to you, what are we going to use the lecture periods for?","width":455},{"text":"Attendance at lecture periods is optional.","width":172},{"text":"What we will be doing in these lecture periods, if you decide to attend, is we are going to treat them like we would treat a discussion section where we will work through worksheets that you will find on the Compass 2g website.","width":735},{"text":"These worksheets will be a combination of multiple choice questions, free response questions and other practice problems and calculations.","width":566},{"text":"If you decide to come to lecture, please remember to bring your clickers and to print out and bring the worksheet associated with that lecture ahead of time.","width":461},{"text":"Prior to coming to lecture, you will also have the option of completing a survey on the Compass 2g course website.","width":409},{"text":"This survey is designed to solicit feedback from you on what topics you feel you are most uncomfortable with.","width":427},{"text":"your response will help guide me on what to focus on in the lecture periods.","width":359},{"text":"For the laboratory portion of this course, you will practice by preparing for lab at home via reading the lab manual, completing the pre-lab quiz for that experiment, and completing your pre-lab notebook.","width":688},{"text":"You will arrive on time for every lab in proper attire, and then you will preform laboratory experiments.","width":384},{"text":"When preparing for and performing these laboratory experiments, you will do this in the mindset of 'What am I doing and why?' instead of 'I'm just going to go and do what the procedure tells me to do'.","width":757},{"text":"Everything you do in an experiment has a purpose and if you can rationalize what each step is supposed to do, that means you have a solid understanding of the theory behind that experiment.","width":600},{"text":"How will you prepare for these labs?","width":176},{"text":"First, we must talk about what types of labs you will perform in this course.","width":266}],
//   [{"text":"The first type of lab is what we call a dry lab.","width":231},{"text":"As you can see in the schedule in the course syllabus the first three experiments in the course are dry labs.","width":444},{"text":"Dry labs are labs that will be on spectroscopy.","width":262},{"text":"These dry labs will not be performed in your assigned laboratory room, instead these will be done in assigned classrooms working in small groups to solve spectroscopy problems.","width":577},{"text":"That will be located in provided worksheets.","width":214},{"text":"The other type of lab is a wet lab.","width":173},{"text":"A wet lab is what you might think of a traditional organic chemistry lab, where you will enter a laboratory and perform some chemistry.","width":487},{"text":"The procedures for these experiments are located in your lab manual.","width":255},{"text":"Now that we know the two types of labs that you will be performing, how do you prepare for each of them?","width":328},{"text":"For dry lab, you will watch the webcast or webcasts associated with that experiment and take notes.","width":393},{"text":"For a dry lab, there is no pre-lab notebook.","width":158},{"text":"There is however a pre-lab quiz which you can find online on the compass2g course website.","width":343},{"text":"It is important that you complete the pre-lab quiz.","width":243},{"text":"If you do not complete the pre-lab quiz you will not be allowed to perform the experiment.","width":322},{"text":"As mentioned previously, these dry labs will not be performed in your normal laboratory room.","width":336},{"text":"Before going to your dry lab you'll need to identify the time and classroom you'll be performing the dry lab in by looking at schedule posted on the compass 2g course website.","width":546},{"text":"You can do this via using you lab section number and/or your TA's name.","width":292},{"text":"Preparing for a wet lab is similar.","width":142},{"text":"As with the dry labs, you will watch the associated webcast or webcasts for an experiment and take notes.","width":349},{"text":"You will then read the lab manual pages for the experiment while thinking about how the procedure lines up with the webcast.","width":457},{"text":"If you can explain how each step fits with the theory discussed in the webcast, then you have a good handle on what the experiment is trying to do.","width":582},{"text":"You will also watch any assigned technical videos located on compass.","width":237},{"text":"These technical videos will show you how to perform each technique ahead of time.","width":336},{"text":"For example, in the TLC experiment, there is a technical video that will show you how to set up a TLC plate.","width":384},{"text":"That way you will have some ideas what to do when you actually get to lab.","width":330},{"text":"For a wet lab, there is a pre-lab notebook and you must complete that pre-lab notebook according to the instructions in your lab manual.","width":416},{"text":"You must complete the pre-lab quiz associated with that experiment on compass.","width":257},{"text":"If you do not complete either your pre-lab notebook or your pre-lab quiz you will not be able to perform the experiment.","width":425},{"text":"Because this is a technical course, or a significant portion of your grade comes from performing experiments, attendance at each lab is required.","width":479},{"text":"Make-up labs are difficult to arrange.","width":163},{"text":"Do not assume you will be given the opportunity.","width":172},{"text":"If you know ahead of time that there will be a conflict due to religious or other accepted reasons, it may be possible to arrange for a make-up experiment if you provide enough notice, at least one week in advance.","width":643},{"text":"It is important to arrive to lab early.","width":245},{"text":"At the beginning of every lab period, your TA will give a short lecture just to go over the highlights of what the lab you will be performing is, some tips to perform it efficiently and safely, some things like that.","width":691},{"text":"You must be there for that lecture.","width":126},{"text":"If you arrive during the lecture, you will receive a 10-point deduction from your lab notebook score.","width":367},{"text":"If you arrive after the lecture is completed, you will be prevented from performing the experiment at all, even if you completed the pre-lab quiz and the pre-lab notebook.","width":627},{"text":"That's a lot of things to practice, and mostly on your own.","width":213},{"text":"What kind of support will you be given?","width":124},{"text":"The final part of practicing for any course is getting help and discussing the material with other people and you will do that with your peers, with myself and your TA, online using Piazza or in person at office hours or via email.","width":889},{"text":"In this course you have the option of using Piazza.","width":184},{"text":"You can find enrollment instructions for Piazza in the course syllabus.","width":238},{"text":"Piazza is a free service which you can think of as a course forum or a course wiki.","width":366},{"text":"How it works is you have a question and you can post a question that is viewable to everyone.","width":423},{"text":"It is also answerable by everyone that means that me, the TAs, and your peers can answer your question, meaning you're more likely to get a rapid response.","width":611},{"text":"It also means that because these questions are public, that if someone has already asked the question you were going to ask and received an answer, you can simply look at their question and their answer to solve your problem.","width":636},{"text":"When posting on Piazza, if you wish, you can post anonymously to your peers, but be aware that instructors including myself and TAs know who you are when you post so make sure that you are polite and follow the rules for posting on Piazza.","width":870},{"text":"Do not be afraid to ask questions.","width":142},{"text":"Now this is a two-way street.","width":93},{"text":"if you are asking questions you should also be trying to answer questions.","width":186},{"text":"Be active and help each other out.","width":157},{"text":"If you're a little nervous about trusting the answers from you peers, don't worry both me and the TAs will be checking every answer that gets posted and make sure the information you are receiving is good information.","width":615},{"text":"Let's say you really want some face-to-face time with either me or your TA.","width":200},{"text":"You can always go to office hours.","width":135},{"text":"My office hours are located on the course syllabus and your TA's office hours will be posted online within the first week of the course.","width":453},{"text":"If you can't come to office hours, but would still like some face-to-face time, email me or your TA and we will do our best to make ensure we can schedule a private meeting.","width":503},{"text":"And finally, of course there's always the old standby of email.","width":163},{"text":"You can always email either myself or the TA if you have a question.","width":308},{"text":"If there are personal concerns you need to discuss with me, use email and not Piazza.","width":290},{"text":"Contact me directly.","width":167}],
//   [{"text":"So far we have discussed what you should be getting out of the course when you're done how you will practice achieving those goals.","width":380},{"text":"Now we're gonna talk how you will be assessed how your grade will be assigned.","width":234},{"text":"You'll be assessed using a number of different tools the first of which is a 'Getting Started' Quiz.","width":450},{"text":"This Getting Started Quiz is designed to assess how well you understand course policy and laboratory safety.","width":442},{"text":"To prepare for this quiz you should be familiar with the course syllabus, the lab manual, and the introductory webcasts being this webcast, the lab safety webcast, and the fundamentals webcast.","width":663},{"text":"Some of the questions in this quiz will have answers that are not located in any of these sources.","width":356},{"text":"Part of working in the lab is having some common sense, and you should expect questions that will test your common sense.","width":450},{"text":"This quiz is graded at the time of submission, in other words right after you submit it so you can take it as many times as you wish to maximize your score prior to the deadline.","width":684},{"text":"There will also be a pre and post lab quiz for every experiment in this course.","width":315},{"text":"For every lab experiment there will be one short electronic prelab quiz that you will find on Compass.","width":332},{"text":"This prelab quiz is primarily designed to be a safety check to assure that you have a fundamental understanding of the experiment.","width":498},{"text":"That means knowing what the procedure is going to be and knowing the safety considerations for the experiment.","width":337},{"text":"If you have prepared for the experiment properly by watching the webcasts and completing the prelab notebook these quizzes should take you no longer than 5 minutes.","width":444},{"text":"These quizzes are very short and are designed to be easy to complete if you've done your homework.","width":371},{"text":"You may use your notes for these quizzes, but you must work alone.","width":235},{"text":"For each quiz, you will be allowed 2 attempts.","width":184},{"text":"The 2nd attempt is designed to accommodate any difficulties you may encounter.","width":243},{"text":"For example locking out accidentally or submitting early.","width":237},{"text":"Be aware that the final attempt will always be the attempt that is accepted.","width":268},{"text":"If you successfully complete the quiz once then take the quiz again but get a lower score, that's the one that's going to count.","width":591},{"text":"The second attempt will always be the one accepted even if that score is lower than the first one.","width":381},{"text":"Each lab experiment will also have one electronic post lab quiz that you will find on Compass.","width":335},{"text":"The post lab quiz is designed to test something different.","width":214},{"text":"The post lab quiz is designed to assess your knowledge and understanding of the theory and practical aspects of the experiment.","width":480},{"text":"You should treat these post lab quizzes as practice for the exam.","width":314},{"text":"This means that you should be comfortable with the materials in the webcasts, and if you have taken notes, you may use those on this quiz.","width":536},{"text":"As with the pre lab quizzes, you'll be allowed 2 attempts to complete this quiz again to accommodate any technical difficulties you may encounter, and once again the second attempt will always be the one that is accepted even if that second attempt score is lower than your first attempt score.","width":939},{"text":"As this is a lab course, you will also be assessed based on your lab experiments and your submitted lab notebooks.","width":311},{"text":"What you submit will depend on the type of lab.","width":236},{"text":"For dry labs, it's pretty simple.","width":99},{"text":"You will be given a packet to work on, and once you complete your packet you will submit that packet to your TA for grading before the end of the period.","width":474},{"text":"For wet labs, you will be submitting your lab notebook pages.","width":250},{"text":"This will include the prelab work that you put into your notebook as well as the notes you take during the lab and the conclusions you write after the lab.","width":562},{"text":"Taken as a whole, the notes in your lab notebook should be complete enough that any other student could repeat your procedure exactly as you did and get the same results.","width":625},{"text":"This means recording things like actual amounts of materials used, writing down any deviations from the procedure that you made, and specific data and observations that are requested.","width":597},{"text":"Instructions on what to record can be found in your lab manual.","width":278},{"text":"You will also find in your lab manual an example pre lab and post lab notebook.","width":403},{"text":"Look at those and use them to guide you on what you should be including and how your notebook should look like.","width":333},{"text":"Once you've completed an experiment, you will then take the perforated pages which for most of you will the white pages of your lab notebook and submit them to your TA.","width":488},{"text":"Your TA will grade these notebook pages based on completeness, the recording of relevant data in the correct format, correct calculations, and reporting your results based on that data, quality data analysis, and so on.","width":828},{"text":"A description of what we're looking for can be found in your lab manual.","width":236},{"text":"The rubric that will be used to grade your first wet experiment will be publicly posted on the Compass 2g course website.","width":448},{"text":"This will be the only rubric that will publicly posted.","width":199},{"text":"However, the format for the rubric for all subsequent wet experiments will be roughly the same.","width":429},{"text":"Feel free to use this rubric as a reference as you proceed through the course.","width":312},{"text":"Finally, there will be two exams and a laboratory practical.","width":257}],
//   [{"text":"Exams will be held as shown in the schedule in the course syllabus.","width":291},{"text":"These will be traditional exams.","width":130},{"text":"You should expect multiple choice questions, free response questions, and other types of questions that are specific to organic chemistry.","width":476},{"text":"Laboratory practicals are different.","width":148},{"text":"Laboratory practicals will be designed to test your practical skills, your ability to perform organic chemistry laboratory techniques.","width":533},{"text":"These will be held as shown in the course syllabus during your normal lab period.","width":239},{"text":"We have just finished discussing all the many bits and pieces that will combine to make up your grade.","width":421},{"text":"The Getting Started quiz, your pre-lab quizzes, your post-lab quizzes, your lab notebooks, the two exams, and your lab practical.","width":457},{"text":"Your letter grades for this course will be assigned as described in the course syllabus.","width":319},{"text":"The lowest pre-lab quiz, the lowest post-lab quiz, and the lowest experimental scores will be dropped at the end of the course.","width":435},{"text":"These don't all have to be from the same experiment.","width":237},{"text":"For this course, there will not be what you might call a curve for most components.","width":314},{"text":"For the experimental scores, and experimental scores only, there may be a standardization if and only if there's a significant difference in grading between TAs.","width":647},{"text":"So far in this webcast we have discussed many different aspects to this course: webcasts, lectures periods, lab periods, quizzes, notebooks.","width":562},{"text":"How does it all fit together?","width":138},{"text":"Here is a diagram which hopefully will help you see how everything in this course fits together.","width":426},{"text":"For the lecture portion of this course, you will watch webcasts and read the lab manual.","width":260},{"text":"Having done that, you will have the option of attending lecture sessions where we will work through problems.","width":409},{"text":"For the last portion of this course, you will watch webcast and read the manual, and then having done that you will complete your pre-lab quiz and your pre-lab notebook, which will allow you to perform the associated experiment.","width":808},{"text":"Once the experiment is done, you then need to complete a post-lab quiz.","width":309},{"text":"The material in your post-lab quiz will be a combination of material from the webcast and material from the experiment itself.","width":467},{"text":"Notice how in this diagram the arrow leading from the lecture portion of the course is larger than the arrow leading from the experimental portion of the course.","width":793},{"text":"That is by design.","width":135},{"text":"The post-lab quizzes will be comprised primarily of material from webcast because your post-lab quiz is designed to test your understanding of the theory and fundamentals behind each experiment.","width":769},{"text":"The optional lecture sessions will solve problems that will help you prepare for these post-lab quizzes in the same way the optional lecture sessions prepare you for the post-lab quizzes, the post-lab quizzes are designed to prepare you for the exams.","width":926},{"text":"One feeds into the other.","width":150},{"text":"The lab portion of the course is similar: complete the pre-lab quiz and pre-lab notebook to prepare you for performing the experiment, which in turn will prepare you for performing the lab practical.","width":670},{"text":"Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the first webcast for this course.","width":224},{"text":"However, there are a few other webcasts that you need to watch.","width":231},{"text":"Remember to watch the 'Intro to Spectroscopy' webcast before coming to the first lecture session.","width":325},{"text":"You should also watch the fundamentals webcast if you are concurrently taking CHEM 232 or need a refresher on organic chemistry fundamentals.","width":578},{"text":"You also have a lab safety webcast to watch.","width":129},{"text":"You should watch that before the due date for the Getting Started quiz.","width":265},{"text":"You will find some of the material in the webcast in the Getting Started quiz.","width":276}],
//   [{"text":"Hello there, this introductory webcast will be about laboratory safety.","width":337},{"text":"This recorded webcast will summarize laboratory safety details that you will find in the course syllabus and in your lab manual.","width":400},{"text":"you are expected to read the course syllabus and the laboratory manual and be familiar with everything in them.","width":322},{"text":"this webcast is not a substitute for reading the course syllabus or the lab manual.","width":293},{"text":"One of the biggest parts of lab safety is being prepared for lab before you make it to lab.","width":408},{"text":"Knowing what you will be doing is the first step for performing an experiment safely.","width":284},{"text":"If you walk into lab with no idea as to what you will be doing, that makes you a danger not only to yourself but to your partner and to everyone around you.","width":513},{"text":"This is why before coming to lab, you must complete your pre-lab notebook and your pre-lab quiz.","width":364},{"text":"If you fail to complete either of those things, you will not be allowed to perform the experiment.","width":319},{"text":"When you come to lab, you should bring a certain set of materials.","width":188},{"text":"This includes your lab notebook, your safety goggles, your lab coat, a calculator, and a pen using blue or black ink.","width":420},{"text":"Anything else, including copies of the lab manual and your cell phones should be stored outside of the lab in the provided lockers.","width":467},{"text":"There is just not enough space in the labs themselves to hold all of the materials you normally bring to a course.","width":390},{"text":"Once you are in the lab, you must remember this rule: you must listen to your TA.","width":313},{"text":"They are there foremost for your safety.","width":154},{"text":"One of the things your TA's will be doing is ensuring you are wearing proper attire.","width":351},{"text":"TA's can and will ask you to leave if you have not worn the proper clothing and/or brought the proper safety equipment.","width":418},{"text":"This is more than simply having it with you, you must also wear the material correctly.","width":294},{"text":"For example, goggles must be worn over your eyes at all times.","width":261},{"text":"They do not do you any good if they are resting on your forehead.","width":250},{"text":"Similarly, lab coats must be on and buttoned at all times.","width":320},{"text":"Your feet and legs must be completely covered.","width":178},{"text":"That means full sized pants or skirts and shoes that cover the entirety of your feet.","width":313},{"text":"If you have long hair, it should be tied back, so as to avoid being dipped in or tipping over materials in the lab.","width":409},{"text":"Similarly, you should have no dangly clothing.","width":145},{"text":"Scarves, oversized lab coats, neckties, bulky sleeves, things like that.","width":307},{"text":"These types of things tend to knock a lot of equipment over, potentially causing a safety hazard.","width":304},{"text":"Lets talk about goggles first: here are a number of different types of safety goggles.","width":372},{"text":"Not all of these goggles are acceptable for you to wear in the laboratory.","width":287},{"text":"For example, if you look in the upper left hand corner, we have what are more correctly called safety glasses.","width":426},{"text":"These glasses are designed to protect your eyes from impact.","width":240},{"text":"They will not protect your eyes from spills and so safety glasses are not acceptable attire.","width":397},{"text":"Similarly, in the bottom left corner, we have a set of typical eyeglass with what we call sideshields.","width":442},{"text":"Again, these are designed to protect your eyes from impact, but not from spills, so these are also unacceptable.","width":466},{"text":"You must wear lab goggles of the type that you see in the upper right and the bottom right.","width":410},{"text":"These lab goggles create a seal around your eyes so that even if you spill something on your face, the liquid cannot drip down into your eyes.","width":654},{"text":"As mentioned, these must be worn properly at all times.","width":229},{"text":"Your TA can and will deduct points from your lab score for continuous improper use of your goggles.","width":517},{"text":"The proper type of lab coat must also be worn.","width":177},{"text":"Lets look at the lab coat on the left: it's buttoned up correctly, but what's wrong with it?","width":271},{"text":"The problem with this lab coat is it is too short.","width":203},{"text":"your lab coat must reach down to about your knees.","width":223},{"text":"That provides the maximum amount of protection for most of your body.","width":249},{"text":"Knowing that, you can probably tell what's wrong with the lab coat in the middle.","width":235},{"text":"The lab coat in the middle has short sleeves.","width":211},{"text":"Your lab coat must have full sleeves.","width":153},{"text":"Having full sleeves provides the maximum amount of protection for your body.","width":400},{"text":"The lab coat you should be wearing should look like the one on the right.","width":221},{"text":"This lab coat has full sized sleeves, it reaches all the way down to almost the knees, and fits properly.","width":448},{"text":"Do not wear a lab coat that is too small or too large.","width":247},{"text":"As with lab goggles, TA's can and will deduct points from your experiment score for improper use of lab coats.","width":437},{"text":"Your lab goggles and lab coats are only one layer of safety.","width":254},{"text":"The clothing you wear underneath them is just as important.","width":268},{"text":"As mentioned previously, a proper lab coat provides maximum protection for your body.","width":330},{"text":"The clothing you wear underneath must also provide the maximum amount of protection for your body as possible.","width":346},{"text":"So for example, things like shorts, and capris are unacceptable.","width":357},{"text":"They do not provide enough coverage for the lower portion of your body.","width":309},{"text":"Similarly, sandals and slippers are also unacceptable.","width":377},{"text":"They leave exposed skin and thus do not provide enough protection for your body.","width":323},{"text":"This list here is not an exhaustive list, TA's have the authority to decide whether the attire is appropriate or not.","width":464},{"text":"Ensure you read your lab manual so that you know what we are looking for when deciding whether attire is

on this slide we have hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring we have hydrogen atoms on the methyl group over here and we have a hydrogen atom here as part of the carboxylic acid as you might imagine just from looking at the molecule there are many different types of hydrogen atoms how might that affect an NMR experiment the chemical structure you see here is of 1-propanol the NMR spectrum you see below it is the proton NMR spectrum for 1-propanol by the end of this webcast you will be able to see how the spectrum corresponds to the chemical structure what a proton NMR spectrum allows us to learn about a molecule are the number of unique sets of hydrogens in the molecule we will learn this via the number of signals in the proton NMR spectrum we will learn about the number of hydrogens in each unique set and we will learn this via the integration of each signal now number 1 and number 2 both sound similar here is the difference number 1 the number of unique sets of hydrogens tells us the number of different types of hydrogen atoms present in the molecule number 2 tells us the number of hydrogen atoms of each particular type proton NMR will tell us the number of hydrogens adjacent to each set in other words, proton NMR will tell us how many neighbors each set of hydrogen atoms has and it will do so via peak splitting, also known as multiplicity proton NMR will also tell us about the presence of nearby functional groups via something called chemical shift finally it will tell us something about connectivity where these hydrogen atoms are with respect to each other in the chemical structure this information is to us via something called J-couplings for this webcast, we will focus on only these first 4 points before we begin, we should discuss labile protons on the previous slide you saw how proton NMR can give us information about a molecule via things like the number of signals, the integration of the signals, the multiplicity, splitting of the signals, and their chemical shifts each of the aspects of the NMR spectrum follows certain rules those rules are what allows us to interpret an NMR spectrum labile protons are special labile protons tend to not follow the rules that you will learn in this webcast it is important to be able to identify labile protons and understand how they may or may not affect a proton NMR spectrum labile protons tend to be acidic protons examples of acidic protons are protons in alcohol and protons in amines these labile protons do not necessarily follow the same rules all other protons follow because of the process called exchange if you look at the structure of 1-propanol here on the bottom left we see a number of protons attached to carbon and we also see a proton attached to this oxygen protons attached to carbon by large stay in one place, they don't move in contrast this acidic proton proton, circled in red, this labile proton does move when we talk about exchange we mean these labile protons exchange between molecules you can imagine this proton being used to protonate, or being transferred to another alcohol this exchange process, this fact that labile protons tend to move around between molecules has a number of consequences unlike most other protons signals in an NMR spectrum labile protons often give broad peaks that do not integrate properly, they often have variable chemical shifts, and they do not always show coupling to adjacent sets of hydrogens we haven't talked about these topics yet but you will understand what these phrases mean as we go through integration and chemical shifts and coupling let's say we have an NMR spectrum and we suspect that we have a labile proton in our molecule is there a way that we can use this exchange process to figure out what signals belong to labile protons the answer is yes what we can do is we can add D2O to our NMR sample why would this help us remember that D stands for deuterium deuterium is simply a hydrogen atom that contains 1 neutron therefore deuterium will exchange with the labile protons in a molecule remember from the previous webcast that deuterium does not appear in a proton NMR spectrum as a result as this labile proton, circled in red, is exchanged for deuterium the signal in the NMR spectrum that belongs to this proton gets smaller and smaller and smaller until it disappears once it has been completely replaced with deuterium the addition of deuterium isn't the only reason a labile proton might disappear chloroform which is the most common NMR solvent is slightly acidic the practical consequence of this is that labile protons may not appear in an NMR spectrum, even without the use of D2O Here's a demonstration of a D2O experiment up top I have the NMR spectrum for this amine and the bottom I have the same spectrum for the same amine but I've added D2O are these 2 spectra different in the top spectra I see this signal here but in the bottom spectra I don't why is that It's because this signal belongs to the protons in the amine as theses protons are swapped out for deuterium this signal disappeared .", "width":22398}],

ether.","width":342},{"text":"These proton NMR signals you see correspond to the protons in diethyl ether.","width":350},{"text":"In the interest of getting more practice, you may wish to spend some more time figuring out which signals correspond to what protons in the structure after the end of this webcast.","width":592},{"text":"If I want to calculate the J values for these signals, I have to be able to convert these ppm values to Hz values.","width":438},{"text":"How do we do that?","width":138},{"text":"The first thing we have to know is what is the strength of our spectrometer.","width":273},{"text":"In this example, these signals were taken in a spectrometer with the strength of 500 MHz.","width":384},{"text":"Now, remember that ppm is calculated by taking the chemical shift of the peak in Hz and dividing it by the strength of the spectrometer, which is measured in MHz, or to give us ppm as our chemical shift.","width":852},{"text":"If I want to take the chemical shift of a peak in ppm and convert it back into Hz, all I need to do is take my chemical shift in ppm and multiply it by the frequency of the spectrometer instrument.","width":953},{"text":"Knowing this information, let's calculate the J value for this triplet on the left.","width":295},{"text":"It is important to know that the J value for a signal is independent of which two peaks you decide to use to calculate it.","width":539},{"text":"For example, in this triplet, I could take this distance between peaks from the left-most peak to the middle peak, or I could take the distance from the middle peak to the right peak.","width":777},{"text":"Either distance will give me the same J value.","width":215},{"text":"Let's say I decide to use this distance on the right.","width":197},{"text":"What I could do is take this value, plug it into this equation, and calculate the shift in Hz, take the second value do the same thing, and then subtract the two values.","width":732},{"text":"That is a perfectly valid way to calculate the J value.","width":180},{"text":"What I prefer to do is instead of converting each of these signals into Hz individually, if you subtract them and then convert them into Hz.","width":620},{"text":"Let me show you that process now.","width":502},{"text":"That is the chemical shift of my middle peak in ppm.","width":199},{"text":"Now I shall subtract the chemical shift of the right peak in ppm.","width":642}],

identical.","width":290},{"text":"This is because coupling constants are reciprocal.","width":258},{"text":"If these two signals result from protons splitting each other, they must have the same

most peak and the middle peak.","width":349},{"text":"What J-value will we calculate there?","width":133},{"text":"What I told you is that we should obtain the same J-value.","width":262},{"text":"But, if you use these numbers on the screen you would instead see a J-value equal to 6.0 Hz.","width":616},{"text":"Why is that?","width":100},{"text":"These chemical

still be acceptable.","width":153},{"text":"So long as your answer is within the threshold, say plus or minus 0.2 Hz, your answer is fine.","width":467},{"text":"Those values are about the same and

intermolecular interactions are relevant in a chromatography experiment.","width":349},{"text":"Why do these intermolecular interactions allow us to separate mixtures?","width":353},{"text":"In a chromatography experiment, the molecules in your starting mixture are in contact with both the stationary and mobile phases simultaneously.","width":578},{"text":"Some of the molecules in your mixture may have strong interactions with the stationary phase.","width":319},{"text":"While some molecules in the mixture may have weak interactions in the stationary phase.","width":267},{"text":"This

spend a great deal of time in the mobile phase, and they will move quickly through the apparatus.","width":474},{"text":"In contrast, molecules that have a strong interaction with the stationary phase will stick well to the stationary phase, and will not spend much time in the mobile phase.","width":577},{"text":"Therefore they will move slowly through the apparatus.","width":163},{"text":"Here is a visual demonstration of a typical chromatography experiment.","width":490},{"text":"This green box represents our stationary phase.","width":227},{"text":"This is the non-moving phase which our

phase.","width":399},{"text":"Therefore it enters the mobile phase and moves across the stationary phase.","width":334},{"text":"Now this does not mean that compound 1 does not interact with the stationary phase at all.","width":266},{"text":"As you can see, compound 1 has returned the stationary phase.","width":239},{"text":"In contrast, compound 2 has not moved.","width":244},{"text":"This

phase.","width":303},{"text":"AS you can see both compound and compound 2 have moved across the stationary phase.","width":328},{"text":"However, they have moved at different rates.","width":237},{"text":"They have partitioned themselves.","width":230},{"text":"Compound 1 has weak interactions with the stationary phase, therefore it moves quickly across the stationary

bonds in the silica gel stationary phase.","width":557},{"text":"The reason the silica gel is polar is because at the surface of the silica gel, we have these silicon OH bonds, and you know that OH is a very polar bond.","width":708},{"text":"The second type of general stationary phase is what is called, reverse phase.","width":338},{"text":"In a reverse phase TLC, the stationary phase is a nonpolar material.","width":386},{"text":"The most common example of this is silica gel that has been what we call 'capped' with hydrocarbon chains.","width":370},{"text":"As you can see here on the

therefore this structure as well can be used as a nucleophile in an aldol reaction.","width":676},{"text":"okay so we can identify alpha carbons and we can identify alpha carbons that are sp3 hybridized.","width":350},{"text":"what makes these particular carbons so important?","width":177},{"text":"what makes alpha carbons so important is their proximity to the carbonyl.","width":350},{"text":"unlike most other CH bonds, the CH bond of an alpha carbon is particularly acidic.","width":448},{"text":"if we add a base of some kind, that base can deprotonate that proton, leading to what we call a carbanion.","width":873},{"text":"now in the past when you've added the base to an organic molecule you have never seen this type of reactivity.","width":1033},{"text":"why is this CH bond different from all of the other CH bonds you have seen in organic chemistry?","width":441},{"text":"what makes this bond different is the carbanion we form can be stabilized via resonance like so.","width":1618}],
//   [{"text":"Now there's no longer an electrophile for this enalate to attack.","width":283},{"text":"So what is this enalate going to do?","width":109},{"text":"What this enalate is going to do is collapse as normal, but instead of attacking an electrophile, it will push this alcohol as a leaving group.","width":724},{"text":"So we have hydroxide, a water equivalent, leaving as a byproduct.","width":564},{"text":"And we have formed a brand new alkene in our product.","width":889},{"text":"And there I go.","width":63},{"text":"That is the condensation portion of an aldo-condensation mechanism.","width":331},{"text":"Taking our aldo product, we once again deprotinate the alpha carbon to create our enalate, and this enalate collapses to push off our leaving group, the hydroxide, to form an alkene.","width":882},{"text":"Now lets talk about this mechanism a little bit.","width":152},{"text":"First, many of you may be thinking that hydroxide is a terrible leaving group.","width":307},{"text":"How can hydroxide leave without being protinated to form water?","width":315},{"text":"There are two primary components to this.","width":112},{"text":"The first, we are in basic conditions.","width":197},{"text":"There's base around.","width":87},{"text":"There is no way to protinate this hydroxide to turn it into a good leaving group.","width":361},{"text":"Two, this final product we make on the right, this alkene is what we call conjugated.","width":405},{"text":"Remember the conjugated means that we have double bonds adjacent to each other.","width":242},{"text":"So we have this c, c double bond and c, o double bond next to each other.","width":391},{"text":"Conjugation is a thermodynamically stable arrangement.","width":237},{"text":"While it costs a great deal of energy to force this alcohol to leave as a hydroxide ion, we gain all of that back and more by forming this conjugated product.","width":732},{"text":"So what we call the driving force, what allows this reaction to happen even though it looks unfavorable is getting lower in energy.","width":545},{"text":"It is the thermodynamic stability of this final conjugated product.","width":351},{"text":"You may be wondering why is it necessary to go through the enalate to go through the alcohol?","width":372},{"text":"Why can't we simply deprotinate that hydrogen atom and eliminate the alcohol in an E2 mechanism.","width":673},{"text":"The reason why the E2 mechanism is not applicable is because this direct concerted process has a very high energy barrier.","width":509},{"text":"Whereas forming the enalate has a much lower energy barrier.","width":221},{"text":"And you know that the lower the energy barrier, which is the energy of the transition state, the faster that process is.","width":422},{"text":"So forming the enalate is a much faster process than doing the direct elimination.","width":299},{"text":"And that is why we go through the enalate when we eliminate the alcohol to form our product.","width":398},{"text":"This particular mechanism that you see here for the elimination of the alcohol is what we call an E1 CB mechanism.","width":617},{"text":"We call this an E1 CB mechanism because it is an elimination, where the rate determining step is unimolecular, as you can see here we have only one species present in the elimination.","width":742},{"text":"And it goes through the conjugate base of the starting material.","width":281},{"text":"Where this enalate is the conjugate base of this ketone acid here.","width":370},{"text":"Take home message from this slide.","width":237},{"text":"The elimination of the alcohol to form the alkene condensation product proceeds through an E1 CB mechanism.","width":526},{"text":"Where a base deprotinates our alpha carbon once again to form again to form our enalate, and our enalate forces off the alcohol as hydroxide ion to make our product.","width":710},{"text":"The alcohol is a terrible leaving group.","width":138},{"text":"The reason this reaction is able to proceed is one, we are under basic conditions so we cannot protinate the alcohol to make a better leaving group and two, the product we make is thermodynamically very stable.","width":746},{"text":"So the energy we pay to eliminate the alcohol is compensated for by the energy we get back from forming our conjugated product.","width":550},{"text":"Now that we understand how an aldol-condensation works lets talk about what you will be performing in the lab itself.","width":437},{"text":"In the lab itself you will perform what we call a double aldol condensation using an unknown aldehyde and an unknown ketone.","width":506},{"text":"Remember earlier in this webcast when we identified how many sp3 hybridized alpha carbons are present in four example carbonyl structures.","width":522},{"text":"On that slide we saw how that structure had 2 alpha carbons that fit that criteria.","width":334},{"text":"Therefore each alpha carbon can perform an aldol reaction and that is what will happen in this experiment.","width":349},{"text":"You will be given one of these four ketones.","width":197},{"text":"All four of which have 2 sp3 hybridized alpha carbons.","width":352},{"text":"And so each alpha carbon will undergo an aldol reaction.","width":278},{"text":"For your electrophiles you will be given one of three possible aldehydes shown here down below.","width":423}],
