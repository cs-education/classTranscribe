  [{"text":"But you know she's in the room, and you wanna ask her your favourite question.","width":310},{"text":"So how would you proceed?","width":105},{"text":"What you think you should do to find her in this room, without knowing how she looks like?","width":381},{"text":"Any ideas?","width":142},{"text":"Yo.","width":45},{"text":"OK, Yo.","width":25},{"text":"What about you to use microphone would that be better?","width":222},{"text":"Ok.Because we can scale up the same problem, you can imagine that the same problem from a couple of hundred of students, we can scale up to a couple of thousand of people in the stadium, and the problem could be stated in the same way.","width":921},{"text":"How to find Cinda over there.","width":84},{"text":"So probability you would want to find a microphone or megaphone and yell her name.","width":394},{"text":"Right?","width":52},{"text":"Fine.","width":41},{"text":"Very good solution.","width":107},{"text":"It assumed something about the data, and the way, or infostructure, in which you can add a few data.","width":467},{"text":"Having a microphone means that you have the access to all of the instances in your data set, in which case database represents people.","width":538},{"text":"So the info structure allows you to access to all of them simultaneously, very efficiently.","width":499},{"text":"You will not always have that info structure.","width":176},{"text":"Right, I can turn off the microphone, and that instance is gone, right?","width":423},{"text":"So do you have a plan B, do you have a second strategy?","width":207},{"text":"How would you find her without a microphone?","width":188},{"text":"Ask every student in the stadium.","width":246},{"text":"Ok, let's do that.","width":77},{"text":"That's a good strategy.","width":56},{"text":"Are you Cinda?","width":62},{"text":"I'm not.","width":33},{"text":"No?","width":4},{"text":"No.","width":2},{"text":"No?","width":17},{"text":"Uh, not.","width":101},{"text":"Is this fast?","width":131},{"text":"No.","width":8},{"text":"No, right?","width":36},{"text":"It's gonna take a long time because I would have to ask every single one of you.","width":297},{"text":"So this is called the Brute-force strategy.","width":134},{"text":"We will use those.","width":71},{"text":"We will have some brute-force algorithm, we will have to just go one by one to each data to complete the search.","width":507},{"text":"But it's not efficient if you have a large dataset.","width":217},{"text":"So can we optimise in a way?","width":211},{"text":"Ask people whether they know where Cinda is.","width":534},{"text":"That's an interesting one.","width":91},{"text":"Do you know where Cinda is?","width":60},{"text":"Yeah.","width":64},{"text":"Yeah!","width":25},{"text":"Oh- wah.","width":63},{"text":"It may or may not shorten your search.","width":294},{"text":"Which is kinda related to some kind of hash algorithms that jump from one reference to another maybe or link list hash.Yes.","width":610},{"text":"Very good, we will cover similar problem in class, for some of the test and one of the data structures.","width":453},{"text":"What if nobody knows where Cinda is?","width":197},{"text":"They don't know how she looks like and you end up with Brute-force right?","width":288},{"text":"Any other way to speed up the search?","width":85},{"text":"Ask the person at the top of each roll.","width":449},{"text":"So I'm gonna go through the aisle and ask to propagate along the rolls.","width":294},{"text":"Is that your idea?","width":207},{"text":"Yeah.","width":73},{"text":"OK.","width":70},{"text":"So it assumes that I have arranged my data.","width":348},{"text":"So I created some kind of organisational data.","width":184},{"text":"I don't spend much time on this but you know whoever build this room, edit it.","width":339},{"text":"So it's kinda investment.","width":100},{"text":"You will see that a lot that by organising your data, you put in some time to do it, but it will be a good trade-off with future searches, right?","width":586},{"text":"It shows trade-off for time and efficiency in your search.","width":379},{"text":"Good.","width":46},{"text":"What if I ask you: You're not Cinda right?","width":409},{"text":"Raise your hand if you are Cinda.","width":352},{"text":"Ok.","width":41},{"text":"It's a very good hash, for this small room right?There is no Cinda in ECE Building as well.","width":482},{"text":"It's also something to think about, how good is your identifier for your data.","width":380},{"text":"Would it narrow down on to only one person or a large group that you would have to further do some kind of search on.","width":552},{"text":"So I'm going to do the following strategy.","width":171},{"text":"I'm going to ask you if you are Cinda and then ask you to ask the same question to all of your neighbours.","width":447},{"text":"And then, you will ask them to then propagate this information, and search.","width":451},{"text":"What would that look like?","width":93},{"text":"How do you make sure that everyone is absolutely right?","width":623},{"text":"Maybe I do want to, maybe I don't care.","width":165},{"text":"Maybe they can propagate back or I just ask them to only ask people who were not asked or didn't ask you before right?","width":446},{"text":"So we have to think about the algorithm in detail there a little bit.","width":447},{"text":"Anyway.","width":34},{"text":"Imagine you asked your neighbours whether they are Cinda and ask them to ask further, and they raise their hands during this time.","width":454},{"text":"How would the search look like?","width":185}],
  [{"text":"This propagation of the- yeah?","width":122},{"text":"Student: Will it be exponential?","width":151},{"text":"It will be exponential in each round and it will propagate like a wave, right?","width":455},{"text":"Some kind of wave form.","width":48},{"text":"So here we go.","width":62},{"text":"So it will- you'll see um...","width":163},{"text":"you'll see instances of different kind of data structures or data organizations in this class and different kinds of ways of searching over them or performing some kind of other task and that's why this class is called data structures.","width":873},{"text":"So I'm- I just had a slide about ways of searching for data in a data structure and this is an example of an organization.","width":616},{"text":"So another metaphor for our class you might not want to invest time to organize the data.","width":424},{"text":"So now there is a chance for me to find out a little bit about you and the question will be a little too personal.","width":389},{"text":"Uh, please raise your hand if your closet looks like this one on the left.","width":317},{"text":"Sorry.","width":32},{"text":"If you don't mind sharing um...","width":168},{"text":"okay...","width":18},{"text":"cool.","width":49},{"text":"I mean not exactly maybe more like, right?","width":168},{"text":"Um, please raise your hand if your closet looks more like the one on the bottom right.","width":462},{"text":"It's half and half.","width":100},{"text":"In my household I have people across the board like both kinds of people.","width":464},{"text":"Uh okay.","width":176},{"text":"Student: Which type of closet do you have?","width":207},{"text":"That's too personal.","width":92},{"text":"I'm more like that and this is my husband okay I'm sorry.","width":334},{"text":"I'm sharing too much.","width":103},{"text":"Okay um, so then I have a question then to those of you who raised your hand, uh, and said that your closet looks more like this and I'm asking you a question.","width":678},{"text":"Wouldn't it be difficult for you to find something, say, you're favorite pink, uh, short-sleeved shirt?","width":587},{"text":"Would it be difficult for you or would you argue that for you its as easy as finding it in a well organized closet?","width":497},{"text":"Please raise your hand if you think its easy to find it in your closet.","width":277},{"text":"Yeah that's what my husband would argue \"that it's not difficult I know the organization.\" The thing is even though it doesn't seem like there was any, um, any time put into organization into this closet there is a data structure, it's just implicit.","width":1053},{"text":"It's hidden in the owner's head, right?","width":152},{"text":"So you have that organization of that closet in your head and and you can access the items pretty fast.","width":347},{"text":"The problem is its not shared with others.","width":150},{"text":"If you were to ask....","width":106},{"text":"if you were on vacation and you were to ask your mom to find your shirt, probably she would have difficulty.","width":371},{"text":"She would prefer if your closet was organized like this, right?","width":298},{"text":"Does that make sense?","width":59},{"text":"There is always, uh, ways to optimize the search.","width":329},{"text":"Optimization helps, it just, or data structure organization helps and, uh, sometimes even though its not apparent it may still be there.","width":619},{"text":"Also, this slide kind of demonstrates the programming style.","width":280},{"text":"If you're programs look like that, it doesn't mean they aren't efficient, its just that it will be hard to share them in a collaboration.","width":539},{"text":"They may still work fine.","width":145},{"text":"Okay, so this is what the class is about.","width":267},{"text":"Now I want to talk a little bit about what to expect from it.","width":303},{"text":"So this is a difficult class.","width":96},{"text":"It is a lot of work.","width":101},{"text":"Um, we will have labs released every week due on every Sunday.","width":506},{"text":"We will have MP's due every other week, so every two weeks there will be a machine problem assignment and there will be three exams.","width":561},{"text":"So another metaphor for this class that...","width":305},{"text":"um, just a second....","width":202},{"text":"that you might feel like the course is really, really tall waves and you're a surfer and you have to, your job is to survive and stay on top of it, okay?","width":1052},{"text":"So its not unheard of that this class takes about 20 hours a week of work and if you're not doing well around the third week and you're not spending 20 hours a week, thats probably the reason why.","width":882},{"text":"So I would recommend, especially if its not easy for you, to spend those hours because from our staff members who took the class and so many other student who successfully finished this class I've heard thats how long it takes each week.","width":1068},{"text":"So, expect to have the time investment to succeed in it.","width":387},{"text":"But its a fundamental class.","width":101},{"text":"Its very fun and its very important for your career in the future.","width":366},{"text":"Uh, now also I wanna kind of warn you about how this class will progress through the next month.","width":403},{"text":"Um so, we will start...","width":237},{"text":"we will get to data structures later.","width":203},{"text":"Probably after the first month.","width":162},{"text":"In the first month we will study the language with which we will communicate with the computer to store the data and data structures.","width":422},{"text":"Our language will be C++.","width":87},{"text":"Uh, please raise your hand if you took CS125 as the prerequisite", "width":356}],
  [{"text":"Okay, and please your hand if you took ECE 220, as a prerequisite.","width":461},{"text":"A minority here in this room it's always the case, it's ECE 220.","width":327},{"text":"Um, which means that in this room we have about 70% of computer scientists, who probably are very familiar with objects.","width":527},{"text":"And, uh, classes.","width":75},{"text":"And, you might feel like in the course of the next month, you'll feel bored when I cover that.","width":400},{"text":"Because C++ allows you to use classes, an uh, you'll be familiar with that, um, with that subject.","width":497},{"text":"Those of you who took C class, and it's about um, 30% here, uh you'll be familiar with pointers and how to manage memory, um and uh, this part of the next month will be familiar to you and you might feel bored, bored as well, so that's okay, because since there's so many from both, I'll have to assume that you know neither Java nor C, and I'll have to bring all of us to the same ground, okay so that's okay to feel a little bored for once, once in a while, it's just important that if you do get distracted, don't miss the point at which I do contents which is something that you don't know, okay?","width":2651},{"text":"So that's, that's important, because there will be something that, you don't know, because unless you took both of them.","width":350},{"text":"Then you have to wait until the data structures part.","width":330},{"text":"Okay, any questions about this?","width":280},{"text":"So, um, I wanna start our lecture today, so I'm done with introductions, every lecture um, throughout the semester will start with the announcements, which will show the status of the current assignments.","width":900},{"text":"And you do have three assignments released today.","width":229},{"text":"Um, so the first one is Homework zero.","width":284},{"text":"If you go to the course website, you'll see it under MPs, and uh, it will be due on Monday in class, and due on Monday on SVN.","width":822},{"text":"So in class means that you have to bring a hard copy of it, in class.","width":612},{"text":"And on SVN means that you will have to submit it electronically, uh, electronically.","width":663},{"text":"Uh, so you have to also submit an electronic version through SVN, and there's the guide, you can go through the Homework 0 specifications and you'll see the guidelines for doing so.","width":752},{"text":"But you have to submit both.","width":110},{"text":"So we provide on the Homework 0 webpage we provide two files, PDF file and TeX file, so if you prefer you can print out a PDF file, do handwritten solutions, bring them to me in class, but then you'll have to scan them to upload them electronically, or you can edit on top of TeX file and then electronically submit your produced PDF file, but you have to print it out still and bring a hard copy to me in class, okay?","width":1788},{"text":"So any questions about this?","width":131},{"text":"Uh, Homework 0 is an easy homework if you have taken CS 173, okay?","width":615},{"text":"Discrete math, prerequisite.","width":144},{"text":"Otherwise if you're struggling with this again it's something that it may difficult for you to continue with the class.","width":475},{"text":"Um, we have also released the first lab, it's gonna be due on Sunday, however we will not grade it for credit, okay?","width":633},{"text":"It's just an exercise for you to, on how to use SVN.","width":324},{"text":"Because we will be communicating through SVN a lot, that's the way we'll be exchanging files throughout the semester, so it's important to learn it, including Homework 0, so want you to go through this process and we'll guide you the process in lab section.","width":926},{"text":"So if you have your lab section the first one will be tonight, go there even though the lab is not graded we still take attendance and you are graded for attendance to uh labs.","width":811},{"text":"So go there and then it will be very easy for both Homework 0 lab and MP1, and future MPs and labs, okay?","width":704},{"text":"So that's lab_intro, also MP1 is available, it's due on next Tuesday midnight.","width":423},{"text":"Tuesdays will be when our MPs are due for the first part of the semester, then it will switch to Thursdays.","width":510},{"text":"So the three assignments, they're easy, so don't expect MPs, all of the MPs be this easy, but there a lot already, so you can see how the class is starting pace up.","width":684},{"text":"If you have any kind of questions, general questions or assignment questions, the best way to reach out to us is to post questions on Piazza, that's why we have so many assistants to help answering Piazza posts.","width":1085},{"text":"Also there will be office hours which are already available, uh you can see which TAs and CAs are available um, on our webpage, we have schedule posted.","width":753},{"text":"So this is for general questions.","width":235},{"text":"Any questions at this point?","width":179},{"text":"And we'll get, we'll start with C++.","width":223},{"text":"Yeah?","width":396},{"text":"This one is very easy, because essentially MP1 is very similar to lab_intro, it familiarizes you with SVN.","width":629}],
  [{"text":"...in the future.","width":100},{"text":"Okay?","width":15},{"text":"So it doesn't mean that I'm going to use it now, that's why the value is still garbage.","width":326},{"text":"So if I want to assign the value, if I want to use this variable now, I will use variable definition.","width":459},{"text":"And how do I write it?","width":130},{"text":"Probably a lot of you know.","width":172},{"text":"If I want to assign a value to myFavoInt, what do I write?","width":423},{"text":"I'll just assign a value.","width":80},{"text":"My favorite value, say 27.","width":179},{"text":"myFavoInt will get my favorite value 27.","width":200},{"text":"So that is a definition of a variable and when I say definition we assign value or give a value.","width":625},{"text":"Give a value...","width":227},{"text":"to variable.","width":74},{"text":"Okay?","width":13},{"text":"So that's super easy.","width":147},{"text":"This is super easy and a little boring but I want to go through the syntax because for more complex types, an integer is not an interesting type variable type but for a more interesting variable type, the syntax will look very similar.","width":916},{"text":"Okay, but so far as I said, this type that I will be discussing first are called primitive types.","width":363},{"text":"They are provided to you by C++ system.","width":164},{"text":"You can google for all the possible primitive types provided to you by C++, but I will just go over a couple of them.","width":589},{"text":"Okay so very similar line, syntactically what is it?","width":273},{"text":"Is it a declaration or a definition of a variable?","width":218},{"text":"And what's it's name, type, value, and location of that variable?","width":247},{"text":"The definition or declaration?","width":163},{"text":"It's both!","width":61},{"text":"What's the name of the variable?","width":160},{"text":"Rating.","width":57},{"text":"Type?","width":144},{"text":"Character.","width":40},{"text":"So the name is rating, the type is character, the value is 'E' and not garbage anymore because we assigned it, we defined the variable simultaneously with declaring it.","width":940},{"text":"And what's it location?","width":146},{"text":"Provided by the system so we again have all four of these defined for this variable.","width":412},{"text":"Similarly I declared and defined the variable u of type double with a value 37.","width":661},{"text":"In the next slide.","width":167},{"text":"So this is an example of declarations and definitions of primitive type.","width":303},{"text":"That is boring.","width":69},{"text":"So the most interesting part of C++ is that you can create other kinds of types and do a lot of things with those and those are called user defined types, which we call classes in C++.","width":786},{"text":"Okay?","width":132},{"text":"So a class, a class will allow for more complex and interesting types that we can use.","width":543},{"text":"But the syntax is very similar, so if you look at this next line you probably can guess what's the name, type, value and location of that variable.","width":752},{"text":"And is it a declaration or definition of the variable?","width":225},{"text":"So what's the name of it?","width":121},{"text":"My favorite sphere.","width":75},{"text":"Whats it's type?","width":143},{"text":"Yep.","width":57},{"text":"So the type is sphere.","width":77},{"text":"What's the location?","width":186},{"text":"Provided by the system.","width":126},{"text":"And what's the value?","width":147},{"text":"So far garbage.","width":130},{"text":"Okay so pretty good?","width":129},{"text":"I use this line and assume that this type has been defined.","width":469},{"text":"If I didn't personally define that type, the compiler will complain about this program.","width":467},{"text":"If the program that I wrote contains this line but doesn't actually have the definition of the class sphere, then my program most likely will not compile.","width":691},{"text":"So you can only use variables of some type once you created them.","width":266},{"text":"And the rest of the lecture today and for the next week couple lectures, we will be going through ways of defining user defined types.","width":667},{"text":"Different ways of defining classes.But before we start with that, I want to define formally what a class is.","width":473},{"text":"So class in C++ is a group of variables and functions.","width":1082},{"text":"And why do we need to have class with this definition?","width":252},{"text":"Classes with this definition.","width":116},{"text":"Oh because you want to do something with instances for this class.","width":246},{"text":"So if I have my favorite sphere of type sphere, I might want to work with this sphere and do something with them.","width":444},{"text":"Just like with type integer of primitive type integer.","width":195},{"text":"I might want to add integers, divide integers, or subtract integers.","width":304},{"text":"I may want to do something with spheres.","width":133},{"text":"So all the instances of type sphere I may want to change the color of the sphere or change the

okay.","width":672},{"text":"It's okay because lab_intro is not for credit anyway.","width":289},{"text":"It's just for an exercise of how to use SVN, and MP1 contributes to very very tiny fraction of

sense?","width":135},{"text":"But if you just do submit it, then we are trying to work in such a way so that up to 50 seats will be overridden for you.","width":713},{"text":"Okay?","width":12},{"text":"So you will get an override, if you submit it with the UIN.","width":183},{"text":"Okay, so what's the purpose of Homework Zero?","width":248},{"text":"Homework Zero is an exercise mostly for you, not for us, so see whether this class is for you.","width":668},{"text":"It will cover some subjects that you already should know from the Discrete Math class that we'll just assume that you know, so it's important that you know them for this class.","width":787},{"text":"We do not put any constraints on how you should work on it, so you can work in groups, you can go on Piazza, and find teammates for your Homework Zero submission.","width":688},{"text":"So you can work in a group with people, you can Google for terms, you can use your textbook for Discrete Math.","width":446},{"text":"However, if you have to Google for every single term in the homework, this class is probably not for you, so that's kind of more an

not..","width":63},{"text":"if it's a variable or function that is not defined.","width":238},{"text":"So you [gibberish], define it somehow, and the thing it's a function that is defined in the standard library.","width":475},{"text":"So I better include the files that contain this function and this function, it sounds that it's gonna print something out in the screen, right?","width":850},{"text":"Okay, so the library that contains that function is called 'iostream'.","width":502},{"text":"But I'm gonna say...","width":184},{"text":"to include it I'm goona say hash sign, include, iostream, okay?","width":865},{"text":"And I know that this is a standard library because of the brackets.","width":389},{"text":"Sometimes I will put it in quotes, and that would mean that it's not necessay standard library, could be some local library that I use.","width":558},{"text":"And also know that iostream is something relating to input/outpur stream.","width":386},{"text":"So you'd probably has a bunch of functions for printing stuff out.","width":308},{"text":"However, since iostream is a standard library, so it's a collection of files that are commonly used in many programs.","width":532},{"text":"It has many different classes defined there.","width":204},{"text":"It has vectors, it has queues.","width":176},{"text":"So a lot of things could have the same function for printing things out.","width":344},{"text":"So how do I know that cout really refers this cout, really refers to printing out all the string itself?","width":629},{"text":"Yeah, we have to say it's a standard class.","width":265},{"text":"That is we have to write down that this cout function should be found within iostream library within standard class definition, okay?","width":748},{"text":"So double semicolon indicates it's a scope resolution operator and it tells the compiler where to look for the function

memory of C++.","width":135},{"text":"So ah let me ah start with a simple example, so imagine that Im writing something in my main function.","width":584},{"text":"Using C++ and Im going to declare a variable x of type integer.","width":571},{"text":"SO I want to know how C++ will interpret the integer as well as what is going to happen with the memory.","width":663},{"text":"So the system will look at this sequence and go \"Oh okay you want to declaring and intend to use variable x so I'm going to give you space for that in memory and since you say your memories name is and that variable has a name a very important property\" the system will give you a piece on the stack.","width":1671},{"text":"The stack will store, stores variable with names.","width":665},{"text":"Wow this is this might sound scary like, Oh my God there will be variable without names?\" and yeah we will have to deal with that, that will not be stack anymore.","width":875},{"text":"The stack is very simple, everything has a name and the memory will give you the memory and the name.","width":415},{"text":"So it will give you the memory and clean it up as needed.","width":216},{"text":"You don't have to worry about many things that you will have to worry about when variables don't have names.","width":439},{"text":"But thats for later.","width":133},{"text":"Okay so this says, okay is that what you need?","width":132},{"text":"Ill give you a chunk of memory, with some address say a40 of variable x of type integer I will allocate the chunk exactly the size that that type needs, however many bits that is.","width":1294},{"text":"and since you didn't give me a specific value, that value will be whatever was at that place before\" Right?","width":525},{"text":"we call it garbage.","width":126},{"text":"Okay so our problem at declaration is that our values stored is garbage.","width":294},{"text":"Fine, so after this assignment statement the system also says, \"Thats great I know exactly what you need, Ill have to put the value five into the x's location.\" Our value for that variable.","width":1019},{"text":"That simple.","width":151},{"text":"Now ah the same process happens with user defined variables not just primitive types, that user defined types.","width":531},{"text":"So if I were to declare a variable of type sphere the system would say, \"Okay I know exactly what you want.","width":615},{"text":"Ill allocate a memory chunk on the stack, um say at address a50 for a variable with the name s of type sphere.","width":796},{"text":"And Ill do whatever the statement tells me about the value of this variable\" Whats going to be the value of that variable upon declaration?","width":761},{"text":"We already know whats going to happen upon the declaration of user defined types.","width":315},{"text":"What is called?","width":81},{"text":"The system calls a constructor.","width":204},{"text":"It could be default, provided by the system or an argument constructor we have written for that class.","width":492},{"text":"So a constructor is invoked here.","width":212},{"text":"It depends which one on other, on something else.","width":342},{"text":"That a constructor is called there and it initializes the values.","width":381},{"text":"S is could be nothing and then there are garbage values.","width":183},{"text":"Or a member data, of that it could be radius, and other um arguments associated with the sphere.","width":557},{"text":"So it could be garbage, it could be default values.","width":220},{"text":"Fine, so it's all good.","width":96},{"text":"Thats how memory is handled on the stack and given to variables.","width":425},{"text":"So today, today we'll care about one more thing that can be stored inside of the stack memory.","width":549},{"text":"Let me give you the syntax for it.","width":218},{"text":"So we'll say, \"Well Im going to declare something of integer pointer.","width":399},{"text":"And

been overwritten right?","width":230},{"text":"Cool.","width":84},{"text":"What's gonna be p itself?","width":283},{"text":"That garbage address right?","width":73},{"text":"So we will see what that

those.","width":437},{"text":"OK, so the first dereferencing, uh, p is fine.","width":365},{"text":"And it's 5 because you put 5 there but it may not have been, right?","width":290},{"text":"Or it may
