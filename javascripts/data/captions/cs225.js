","width":403},{"text":"here..a few grad students. Ok.","width":156},{"text":"Alright. Let's see. Anybody else have a question? I have a puzzle for you.

How are you going to find Tom Bogue?","width":192},{"text":"Can you yell loud enough from over there so I can hear you. Oh, call him or text him on his phone right? Yo Tom, meet me at the... Alright, so there's technology there that makes that possible, what's that? What is the detail that makes that possible? His cell number, that's right.

I could, oh, oh that's kind of cool, that broadens the bandwith of things. He said to ask individual people if they had seen him.

We can be clever with the mechanism we use to arrange our data in the first place.","width":576},{"text":"Now the real question is if you're looking for your purple long sleeve button down.","width":448},{"text":"Would you rather look for it in this closet or in this closet?","width":384},{"text":"Yeah, obviously.","width":512},{"text":"Alright, all you do is go the the button downs and it's right there. Right?","width":192},{"text":"Where this one you do your back linear search.","width":256},{"text":"Alright so, our algorithms and our arrangement of data in memory are two things.","width":512},{"text":"And it's the whole course. Any questions or comments?","width":320},{"text":"Ok what's it like? Eh, you can read that later.","width":320},{"text":"It's a puzzle solving course.

I don't want to know. Alright.","width":384},{"text":"Where did you come from? So I think that many of you can raise your hand if your introductory course, your prerequisite course is 125. ","width":576},{"text":"That corresponds a lot to the CS majors a probably minors.","width":192},{"text":"Raise your hand--ah this is so hard. I cannot remember what the prerequisite course is for ECE. Which one is it?","width":576},{"text":"Did that hurt?","width":128},{"text":"To talk to me? Ok.","width":128},{"text":"Alright. And what's your name? Matt, ok. Thank you.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. So it is 220. Good alright. That's the prerequisite course.","width":512},{"text":"Now the amazing thing is that you guys in 220. You people in 220 learn everything you need to know about C.","width":576},{"text":"And that means things like pointers and memory and being responsible with your memory.","width":768},{"text":"And if you came from CS 125 it means that you know everything that there is to know about objects.","width":768},{"text":"Well guess what, in this course we seek to unify. And so we're going to use C++. And the dated version for a very deliberate reason.","width":640},{"text":"We're gunna use C++ and the cool thing about it is that there is a little something in for everybody.","width":512},{"text":"C++ has pointers, that is we control our memory at a lower level.","width":512},{"text":"But it's also object oriented. ","width":384}],
  [{"text":"Now, if you know everything there is to know about pointers, I'd still suggest that you use that as a springboard to learn, perhaps a little bit new, how C++ deals with memory a little differently, at least syntactically, from C. So you will still not want to disengage, you will still want to be disengaged with the idiosyncratic differences between C and C++.  And now, in the previous sentences replace pointers with objects and the same is true for those of you who came from 125.  Even if you already know about objects, you will find new idiosyncratic things in C++ that you should learn about. So, these two things even though parts of them are familiar, as a whole they will be slightly different.  My take will be, my emphasis will be to differentiate C++ from your previous experiences.  So I'm going to assume that you know for loops, variable assignment, function calling, I really am going to assume that you have had the introductory course, cruise right on past that basic stuff (conditionals, what) cruise right on past that basic stuff and into the ways that it differs, and the ways that it will serve us in learning about data structures.  Any questions?  Alright.  Let's work.  So, the first c++ - and I have 15 minutes - can we find - 13 minutes - we're going to get a ton of stuff done. Because you already know a lot of what I'm about to tell you.  You already know it.  You already know that when you declare and define a variable in your prerequisite language that it has the following characteristics.  You might not have thought about it explicitly before.  But I'm pretty sure it won't surprise you when I tell you every variable has a name, and a value, and in our languages of choice, it has a type, and they have memory locations.  That is the value of this variable is stored someplace.  Okay?  Any of that surprise you?  Alright.  So, uh, like these other languages C++ has some primitive types.  These are things that you can look up.  We make a declaration in c++- for completeness you can look them up.  We make a declaration in c++ in a way that won't surprise you.  If I want a boolean I'm gonna call it a bool.  Cat.  Like this.  Okay?  So I declare the variable - what's the variable name?  Cat.  What's it's type?  Boolean.  What's its value?  This is tricky.  What's its value?  Okay.  Anytime you ask what's its value and there isn't an automatic known everybody answers the same thing we're all sure we're all on the same page, then what you have to think is it is garbage.  It absolutely has no value.  Now, it's true, that some c++ compilers will stick in, you know, a default value for you.  But, we're never going to rely on that.  We're always going to assume it is garbage until we give it, until we explicitly give it the value that we want it to have. so, oftentimes, these primitive types will be accompanied by an assignment statement much like this.  So that statement is equivalent char rating; rating = 'E';.  We can do them both in one go.  Any question about it?  Okay, fine.","width":5120}],
  [{"text":"so bad it's, uhh. So bad... It's good. Okay, The key thing to notice there is sometimes if you don't include your decimal to reinforce the fact that you're not dealing with integers, the compiler will yell at you.","width":1280.4},{"text":"So, you know, that is the shortcutting a ton of ridiculous debugging time right there. ","width":320.4},{"text":"All right, any questions about that?","width":192.4},{"text":"No. Here is what I think. I think you should be sleeping. Kuhh, we had known about variable declaration for at least a semester now. ","width":576.4},{"text":"So, here is where things get a little bit more interesting. ","width":256.4},{"text":"It turns out that the set of primitive types of things we can use to declare variables is not enough.","width":384.4},{"text":" In many many almost all circumstances, in fact, we want to define our own types to use as the bases for declaring variables.","width":704.4},{"text":"Okay? In C that was structs; in JAVA it was classes and in C++ it is classes.","width":384.4},{"text":"Alright, so here's what we gonna talk about next.","width":192.4},{"text":"User defined types in C++, those are classes.","width":512.4},{"text":"Okay? And I will show you the syntax for defining a class in just a minute because I wanna start with how do you use a class once it is defined and available to you.","width":704.4},{"text":"Well, you use it.","width":128.4},{"text":"This is different. This is different than in JAVA.","width":128.4},{"text":"You use it just like you do a primitive type and, in fact, a software engineering principle says that when you write a class, you create a type that can be used just as if it is a primitive type.","width":960.4},{"text":"It is sort of one of the standards for completeness.","width":128.4},{"text":"Okay? Alright, so if it's just like a primtive type and if my class name is sphere, then I declare a variable of type \"sphere\" using this statement.","width":896.4},{"text":"Any question about it?

But it exists in the language definition and so we have to end that statement.","width":384.4},{"text":"There's like this \"ghost\"  statement here.","width":128.4},{"text":"Okay?","width":64.4},{"text":"So, another common mistake to make is to forget that semicolon because it feels redundant.","width":384.4},{"text":"Feels like I put a closed bracket there and it must think I'm done with my class definition but you are not.","width":384.4},{"text":"Okay, so, well, uh, here we go.","width":384.4}],

","width":351},{"text":"In our first class","width":192},{"text":"We were defining class sphere.","width":256},{"text":"The reason why we wanted to define a new class is because we wanted to declare things of type sphere, and low and behold, sphere is not a primitive type in C++.","width":832},{"text":"So my objective and my goal is, mmm, I'm not going to be fluent with this tablet yet, and I apologize, but I'm working on it.","width":474},{"text":"My goal is to be able to make a declaration of type sphere of a variable whos variable whose name is beach ball.","width":792},{"text":"For example, okay? Now the question is how do we make that happen? The answer is to define a class whose name is sphere.","width":640},{"text":"The details of defining a class are like this","width":256},{"text":"You understand that there is this public access system, but you don't necessarily know what that means","width":446},{"text":"And a private area in the class definition","width":192},{"text":"You don't know yet what that implies, and that's okay.","width":256},{"text":"Then you go to the drawing board and you think, okay, what kind of functionality do you want from a sphere and how do you represent a sphere.","width":704},{"text":"That is, what data do we need to umm keep about a sphere. So when we talk about the representation.","width":576},{"text":"What we're really talking about is what data will characterize anything of class sphere.","width":176},{"text":"So ... raise your hand if you have an idea of data that will characterize a sphere.","width":429},{"text":"Yeah? Whether it is round or not. Guess what? We're going to implement it so that it is round","width":459},{"text":"Okay? Sphere will be round","width":128},{"text":"Okay? That is just... we'll make that happen","width":182},{"text":"Yes, so if I tell you something is a sphere and I give you its radius","width":384},{"text":"You know what that sphere is, right?","width":192},{"text":"There is only one sphere that has that radius... well, sorta","width":327},{"text":"We're going to use ... uhhh ... radius ... oh wait","width":500},{"text":"Could I use diameter instead?","width":128},{"text":"Yes, could I use surface area instead?","width":407},{"text":"That would be crazy, but yeah, because you'd have to take square root.","width":549},{"text":"How about volume? Could I use volume instead of radius to characterize my sphere?","width":384},{"text":"Is there only one sphere with volume ... whatever?","width":338},{"text":"Now, again, we are in a design discussion. Why wouldn't I use those?","width":355},{"text":"Why wouldn't I use those other things?","width":192},{"text":"Yeah? Yeah, they induce time to evaluate, right?","width":512},{"text":"Like if the only thing I care about about a sphere is its volume, then I might use its volume","width":406},{"text":"But probably, for a general purpose sphere, I can most quickly get to what I want by keeping its radius, and doing simple arithmetic","width":667},{"text":"Simple arithmetic in every direction to get the data, or the information that I want from it.","width":394},{"text":"So I'm not going to keep... you're going to have to forgive all the slide switching. That is my fist on the ... thing.","width":502},{"text":"I'm going to keep the radius. Okay? That's going to be my representative. ","width":448},{"text":"Now, the reason why we keep the radius instead of the volume, say, is taking cube roots is expensive computationally. Okay? So that's the piece of it...that is... that's the piece of it that's hard. That's why we decide on radius","width":923},{"text":"Whereas cubing something ... not expensive at all.","width":320},{"text":"Who knew? You thought they were uhhh you thought they were inverses of each other. You didn't care. We care.","width":461},{"text":"Okay, so now we know how to represent this beach ball.

  [{"text":"So, alright. We are going to keep sphere and denote it by its radius. What do we want to do with the spheres? So, once I have beach ball here, what do I need to be able to do with it? yeah? I might want to get the diameter from it. That's right. I might want to get information about it. I might want to get information about sphere. Anything else? I might want to do? yeah? I might want to change it. That's right. I might want to change information about it. I might want to change the radius. ugh, change it. OK? And, the last one is kinda implicit, and I already done it. We might want to create a new one. If you are coming from Java, this basically constitutes a collection of geters and seters right? We need to get information and change information. In C++, we do that ourselves explicitly. We don't just get ask for them. So, we are going to write the code to do it. Now, before we write the code to actually implement it, these things, we declare them. Now, here is the story, for the representation in practice, we are always going to put the declaration of the member variable, that's what those are, in the private section, cause we want to controll the access. Talk about that more in a second. So, in the private section of our class defination, I am going to write double theRadius. And now, I am going to use my functionality list, as essentially a checklist for the declarations of the functions I am going to implement. To declare the class defination. So, one two and three there are my checklist, and I am going to go through there, and start to declaring functions, achieve that functionality. OK? alright. So, the first thing I want to do is get information. If I am getting information from the thing, then I better have a return type. Better have a way to accepting the information. Ugh, what I am going to do is, oh, sorry, erasing, hmm. oh, no.. What I am going to do is, to have a function, with return type is double, whose name is get, probably one of these for radius,  diameter, volume and surface area. But the one I am going to use for an example is get diameter. There are no parameters to that function, and the declaration, ends with semicolon. And I will show you how to use that function that has no parameters in just a sec. Now, we are done with get information. Now, what does it look like when we want to chage one of these things? Well, we don't expect a return type, we might have a boolean in there to see weather we have been successful. The name of it might be setRadius(), and this time, we do want a parameter. We are going to pass setRadius, a double, whose name is newRadius. Hey, again, it is a declaration, and it ends with a semicolon.

This is what private means.","width":320},{"text":"Anything in this private sections is not accessible via the object itself.","width":640},{"text":"So this thing is not allowed.","width":256},{"text":"Because the radius is private","width":384},{"text":"Alright I have a little piece of vocabulary to give you and that is the following.","width":512},{"text":"This code in the blue box is called client code. Anything that uses a class definition is referred to as a client.","width":768},{"text":"It doesn't mean that you could expect payment or anything. It just means, \"users\".","width":384},{"text":"So this is sphere class client code.","width":704},{"text":"And so now I can say the sentence: private members are inaccessible to client code.","width":640},{"text":"Private members are inaccessible to client code.","width":256},{"text":"Clients cannot use anything declared in the private session.","width":384},{"text":"Similarly the reason I can use these two is because they're public.","width":448},{"text":"We've laid them out there, right? Like this is permission.","width":192},{"text":"This is not friends, or family, or U of I. This is everybody. Everybody can use this.","width":448},{"text":"Okay. Use these functions. Any questions about this?","width":320},{"text":"Yes?","width":192},{"text":"Yes, exactly. We're gonna talk about that in just a second.","width":320},{"text":"So his question was \"can we access the radius via functions?\".","width":128},{"text":"Of course we can cause we have a function that allows us.","width":192},{"text":"\"setRadius\", right? So we have to go through setRadius to change the radius.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. Yes","width":320},{"text":"You don't need a constructor to create the object.","width":192},{"text":"The system will provide one for you, but it's a really really stupid one.","width":256},{"text":"So you probably want to create your own.

It looks like theRadius equals r.","width":663},{"text":"And we could say if r is grater than 0 do that, else theRadius equals 1.0, say.","width":803},{"text":"Okay? Alright any questions about that?","width":210},{"text":"Yes","width":379},{"text":"Very good question. The question is can we use the initializer list for this constructor the answer is yes and that syntax looks exactly looks like you would expect.","width":809},{"text":"That syntax, I'm gonna put it in a different color ink because it's alternative code, OHHHH, would look like theRadius and have an r in it.","width":892},{"text":"Okay you can refer to the parameters in that initialization list.

Okay?","width":510},{"text":"So that is point one about constructors.","width":252},{"text":"If you do not provide a constructor, the system will give you a no argument constructor so you can't do this little trick of instantiating the variable without defining yourself.","width":1280},{"text":"A no arg, okay?

Those 3 words are inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism .... Okay, this is interview prep. They are going to try and trip you up. they are going to see if you have seen this moment. How are object oriented programming languages typically characterized? Now what you will know is that there a lot of different ways of characterizing object oriented programming languages. But what they are looking for is those 3 words. And if you can reel off inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism, they will go 'Oh wow, this person knows what they are talking about.'","width":3584},{"text":"But, in case they dig a little more deeply into your understanding of C++. Despite the fact that this is not a C++ class, I want to tell you specifically how we describe the ways in which C++ supports the idea of encapsulation. Now what is encapsulation besides an E-word?","width":1600},{"text":"It is a separation of the interface of the class from its implementation. Now there are 2 ways that C++ does this. One is that the private region of the class definition protects the data associated with the object. ","width":2240},{"text":"And so you as the designer, because you believe in this idea, this is what you do in C++.","width":1024},{"text":"Secondly, this is purely by convention, you already saw today that you don't have to do this, but by convention we separate the .cpp file, the function implementation, from the header file.","width":1408},{"text":"We separate the function implementations.","width":1088}],
  [{"text":"Any questions about that? Okay that's just vocabulary. So the same two things. Listen just a minute and do another sort of high level view. So, these circles represent code for a class definition, consider a single class at this point, we've already said that we separate into a header file and implementation file. So the example is sphere.cpp and sphere.h and the vocabulary we use for that .h is interface because I can give you a .h file and you know how to use the class, you don't need the .cpp to get everything you need from the .h file. Now what are all these little blue bubbles? That one is my neighbor Virginia. Here is the main that I happen to use. Maddox came to my office, said hey you got a sphere I can use? I said sure, here's the idea. HEre's what encapsulation gets for you. It allows you to make it so that all these clients can do their business looking only at the interface and it can build a wall , demands that a wall is build between the clients and the implementation. The client can see everything they need to know about the interface and don't need to worry about the implementation. Any questions? It streamlines the communication about these classes at exactly the right level of abstraction. The substance of today is actually memory. If you came from CS125, most of what we've done is pretty much familiar. But it's probably very new if you came from the CE engineering prereq. If you came from the ECE department, you have a pretty good handle on memory.

But last night there were only 3 people and 4 course staff. For those of you who do not know what I am talking about with the queue and the office hours. What you are going to do is go to chara.cs.illinois.edu. And put your name on the queue and the course staff will come find you.

Good!","width":128},{"text":"Value","width":128},{"text":"Reference ","width":192},{"text":"and pointer by value. Now that whole discussion was kind of a bridge between passing by value and passing by reference because the behavior of the system and whats happening behind the scenes is the same as passing by reference but reference gives you simplicity and some cleaner ways of stating your intentions.","width":1856},{"text":"So this is a pointer by value","width":320},{"text":"Ok","width":128},{"text":"and you should kind of review the implications of each of those and syntax..

No so we cout the name and change this to true and then what are we returning?","width":1536}],

In the flow of the program. Then we assign it the value of d. Is this syntactically in type wise correct?","width":726},{"text":"Is work okay type wise? Yes, it does. 'd' is a student pointer 'w', this is the address of the student, those are the same thing. So type wise this works fine.  But let me ask you this.  What happens to 'w,' the second we leave the function? What happens to 'w'? Yeah? That's right!  The system does you a favor.  It clears the right off the stack.  Boom boom done.  Right? So 's' and 'w' are effectively gone because they were local to the function.  So what about the address of 'w'?  How do you feel about the address of 'w' out here in the calling code? Daaah!  Right? It's no longer valid!  Now will it work? Will this code work?  Most of the time, maybe? It's probabilistic thing.  You are rolling your die here.  So, the point of which this assignment is made, the point of which this assignment is made relies on the 'w' that is no longer in scope.  So, but, 'w' is not in scope.  So this is a horrific bug.  Why is it horrific?  It's worse than insidious.  Why is it horrific?  Because it might work a lot of the time you probably won't get a seg fault.  Another parts of, other times, you might get a seg fault, other times you would just get a value that you don't understand because that stack has been reassigned to be something else by some other process. Okay?  Alright.  So what was the error here?  What did we do wrong?  What did we do wrong here?  Yes?  We used stack and we returned what from the stack?  A memory address of something on the stack.  That's right.  We returned the memory address of stack variable.  Now returning that thing by value would have been fine.  Returning 'w' by value would have been perfectly fine.  So if 'd' were instead just a student and we had just returned 'w' here, then things would have worked fine.  That's returning by value, yes?  So the address is memory address.  It's the location in memory.  And, we returned it because there's nothing that says we can't return something of pointer type.  Right? We returned it pointer type.  So that types match up across this assignment statement.  This is pointer, this is pointer.  No problem.  Right?  Except that the thing that we instantiated that pointer with that, is, ephemeral, kind of.  Alright, any question about it?  Is it okay?  Alright.  That's the, that's the warning.  Don't return a local variable memory address, local variable's memory address.  Okay fine.  Uh, let's do something else.  Return by value would've worked fine here.  Returning a student would have worked fine.  Let's do something else.  Uh, let's talk here about... How would you describe that?  What have we done here in this function?  Are we returning a student?","width":1826}],

  [{"text":"Okay, now if you don't write an explicit copy constructor the system will provide you one, and I'm going to tell you a narrative about what the default one give you in just a second.","width":768},{"text":"Okay, so one location where the copy constructor is called is when you pass parameters in, that's how by value happens, that's how pass by value happens.","width":832},{"text":"Another case that it happens is like this. You are allowed to declare a sphere and then to declare another sphere to be a copy of that one.","width":1088},{"text":"Okay, so maybe in here you would change a somehow. And this b, the declaration  of b with another sphere as an argument is as close as we come to explicitly invoking the copy constructor.","width":1418},{"text":"Okay, any question about that?","width":496},{"text":"Okay, there is a third use that merits a complex discussion.","width":448},{"text":"That third use actually occurs in the first example perhaps. Ah I cannot change my pen color, I'm so sorry, things are kind of broken here.","width":704},{"text":"So the question is what happens when you say return s?","width":576},{"text":"We sort of implied that the execution is the same between passing a parameter and returning a parameter.","width":768},{"text":"But in this case, actually, that copy constructor may not be called, it may not be called.","width":614},{"text":"The system will decide whether or not it knows what you mean and in certain circumstances the copy constructor will not be called.","width":613},{"text":"So you cannot rely on the copy constructor being called upon returning by value.","width":448},{"text":"So let's see, where can I write that? This may or may not call the copy constructor.","width":704},{"text":"And the reason for it is simply that when you're returning a value, if you can maintain the data in memory some place, making another copy of it ends up being like an extra copy.","width":1024},{"text":"So you're code actually executes faster if it doesn't have to make extra copies all over the place and so where it can it will avoid invoking the copy constructor.","width":768},{"text":"Alright, any question about it? We'll talk about it more later. We say that the return copy is elided, if you wan't vocabulary associated with it.","width":896},{"text":"Okay, so we need a copy constructor and I said the system provides one for you.

Because the alternative is passed by value.","width":1600},{"text":"Peanut butter value.","width":192},{"text":"And pass by value invokes the copy constructor.","width":640},{"text":"Which is what we're trying to define.","width":384},{"text":"So I encourage you to go test it out and see what happens when you try to set up a copy constructor pass by value.","width":1472},{"text":"Okay, another question. What does it mean that the copy constructor's parameter is constant. So I'm asking you exactly about the present of that constant there.","width":768},{"text":"I think we talked about it really really briefly. What does it mean in that context? Yes, the parameter very good. This promises that the copy constructor and the function in general will not change that parameter.","width":320}],
  [{"text":"Ok, so orig is effectively constant. Ok, um, last time we saw the, um, we saw that parameter used here. What's the difference?","width":832},{"text":"What's, I mean it's not a parameter, that keyword used there instead. What's the difference between using it at the end and using it in the parameter list?","width":576},{"text":"Do you remember what it meant when we used it at the end?","width":256},{"text":"I'll put a little question mark, here. Do you remember what it meant? Yeah, Nathan?","width":576},{"text":"Right, so this time, this time, if you put it here it means that the function will not change those guys, the data members associated with the class.","width":640},{"text":"So, it's still a promise that something will be held constant and it's just an issue of which thing will be held constant. Ok?","width":576},{"text":"Now, i wanted to spend a second and just tell you how I  happen to read that parameter list in, um, in, uh, English.","width":640},{"text":"I read it like if you asked me, \"What is orig? What type is orig?\" I would say it's a reference to a constant sphere. A reference to a constant sphere. Ok?","width":896},{"text":"So, orig is a reference to a constant sphere. You will also see in your programming journey, you will see that keyword const here, and in that case, the English makes more sense. We just read it backwards.","width":1024},{"text":"Reference to a constant sphere. They're just different syntaxes. Uh oh. What's the plural of syntax? Syntaccc . . . I don't know the plural of syntax. They're just syntactically different ways of expressing the same, uh, the same functionality. Syntactically different ways of expressing the same functionality. Alright.","width":1856},{"text":"That's kind of a meta thing, right? I found a syntactically different way of saying syntaxes. Alright, any questions about it? Alright, so, const will come up. You'll see it in code that you maintain and read. Um, we will also kind of gradually ask you to use what we call const correctness.","width":1472},{"text":"Now, as, as we ask you to write code. Now, what does that mean?","width":256},{"text":"It means that you, as a software designer, should be aware of what you expect to allo-allow to be changed.","width":640},{"text":"So, for example, as I define a copy constructor, I'm pretty sure, that making a copy of something shouldn't do something crazy to it like change it to 42 or something, right?","width":896},{"text":"And, so, this is a way of promising inside the code, no matter how you implement the copy constructor, that the original value will not be changed. Ok, that's called const correctness. Yes?","width":1472},{"text":"Though, right, so the, so functionally you could eliminate the const and then just, you know, be a good steward of the code, right? Well, I'm not gonna write any code to change that. But, here's the thing. ","width":896},{"text":"This construct allows for, um, delegation of code construction responsibilities, right? So, I can now give it to you to write the code and you are not allowed to write bad code that will change that, that, um, the value on the left hand side. So it's a matter of security, actually. Ok?","width":1600},{"text":"Now, it sorta fails in some context. This is purely an aside, so, if this does not interest you then it's ok to kind of turn down the volume a little bit. Um, but, it's not a pure, um, it's not a pure security measure, because, you know what? Sometimes, we want to use the copy constructor to count how many times a copy has been made, say.","width":1728},{"text":"So in that case, and we might want to store that with the object. And, so, that level of, but, but if you make it const you can't allow for it because you can't, you can't record the state change within the object.","width":960},{"text":"So, you know, in effect, it ends up being functionally limiting, but it's ok. For our purposes, const for the input parameter. ","width":704},{"text":"Um, and in fact, there are many style guides, software engineering style guides, that will tell you that all reference parameters should be const.","width":704},{"text":"Ok, so, if you go work for Google, they're gonna tell you that, and you're gonna go, \"*Gasp* What?\"","width":384},{"text":"But, but, um, uh, we don't make that constraint here. But, there are principles involved in the use of const. Ok, any questions about that? That was too much for a bridge on my part. I apologize.","width":896},{"text":"Alright, here's the big kicker though. We spent all this energy talking about this, um, copy constructor. Whereas, the first thing I said to you was, you know, the system provides one.","width":768},{"text":"What was wrong, in this case, what was wrong with the system provided copy constructor, and in general, how would you be able to diagnose for a class whether a custom copy constructor was necessary?","width":960},{"text":"So, what about this particular class demanded that we had to define a copy constructor?

I'm gonna take you through another little piece of code, ","width":640},{"text":"Here's how this piece of code goes. ","width":256},{"text":"this time, I'm going to declare a sphere pointer b","width":448},{"text":"So here's b, and i'm going to ask for a new sphere ","width":384},{"text":"Now, we've made a constructor for a sphere, we made a constructor for a sphere, that sets up a default sphere to look like this","width":806},{"text":"so when I say new sphere, that constructor is called for us. so at the end of this statement, it's perfectly reasonable for me to draw this picture","width":896},{"text":"Making note of the fact that the sphere constructor was invoked for us. ","width":449},{"text":"not the copy constructor, the no argument constructor,","width":384},{"text":"any questions?","width":584},{"text":"Ok, now, let's look at what happens when we say delete b. ","width":491},{"text":"What do you hope happens when you delete b? When you say delete b what do you hope happens? by default. ","width":576},{"text":"what do you hope happens? All of this memory, all of this memory is given back to the system, right? by default, without the destructor, only this part is given back","width":1024},{"text":"no dynamically allocated memory, no memory allocated with a new, is given back","width":448},{"text":"so again, we're responsible for writing a destructor that makes that happen, this is the same destructor, it's just used again","width":595},{"text":"so if you rememebr that code looked like, this","width":256}],
  [{"text":"And it is responsible for clearing up the dynamic array. The rest of it is taken care of. Alright, so I at least, found this a little bit confusing at first, because all of this is the result of a delete statement on a sphere pointer, right? But that delete statement invokes a function that also uses a delete statement. So there are kind of two levels of abstraction going on here. Alright, here's the secret, here's the secret, it's probably the case, so each of these things is a string. How do you think a string is implemented? What do you think the string class looks like? It's a type it has a class, it's just standard. Yeah? Yes, a character array, that's right. Is it a static array or dynamic array? Is it on the stack or the heap? It's a heap, it's a dynamic array. So inside this string class is a dynamic array, or we don't really know, it's encapsulated away from us, but we have every reason to believe it is a dynamic array. So how come I don't have to worry about that dynamic memory? Well I write this, why don't I have to say, \"Oh wait I have to clean out my strings?\" Why? Who's they? So the people who implemented string, that's right. Exactly. So strings clean up after themselves. And look what we have done, we have written it so that spheres clean up after themselves. Right? Now, if you have a class that wants to make a dynamic array of spheres, they never need to worry about it, because when spheres go out of scope, they're just gone. When you call delete on a sphere, it's all gone. No big deal. Okay? So there's multiple layers here of things that work. Alright any other questions about this? Alright, fine. Here are some sort of summery information about destructors. We don't call the destructor, we provide it for the system to use in two situations, when a variable goes out of scope, and when delete is called on a pointer to an object of type \"x\".","width":12544},{"text":"And so it's when a variable of type \"x\" goes out of scope. And it's x's destructor is never called. ","width":1152},{"text":"Okay any question about that? So, it's referring to a class, some class. Alright so now, how do we know if we need a destructor? And the answer is, if your constructor allocates dynamic memory, or if any other member function allocates dynamic memory associated with the object. So it's not just the constructor, but if any, if your object has dynamic memory associated with it, you need a destructor. ","width":1984}],
  [{"text":"And allocates dynamic memory. Heap memory is equivalent there. Okay any question?","width":613},{"text":"And then as we saw, a destructor typically consists of the sequence of delete statements, which means, and the way you handle that is basically to go through your private members and go \"Hey! Do I need to delete that?\" No. The answer is no. \"Do I need to delete that?\" No. \"Do I need to delete that?\" Yes.","width":1361},{"text":"So you go through each of the data members and ask yourself whether or not you have used dynamic memory. It's just a checklist.","width":392},{"text":"Okay, questions? Is it good? Okay.","width":323},{"text":"One more problem. Let's trace a little bit of code. I'm going to declare a sphere a and sphere b. ","width":647},{"text":"Okay so here's a, and here's b. And I'm gonna give 'a' value. That is, I'm gonna instantiate 'a' to be something.","width":753},{"text":"4.8, 3, and \"black and white\", \"bouncy\", and how would you characterize a soccer ball? Yeah all spheres are round, but okay fine.","width":1418},{"text":"Whatever, not worth the time. Alright, so now the question is \"What happens when we do that statement?\"","width":716},{"text":"What do you think happens when we do that statement?","width":536},{"text":"A member-wise copy. That's right. The assignment operator is by default member-wise. So again we have this groaner of a situation where 4.8 is copied appropriately, 3 is copied appropriately, and the pointer value is copied appropriately.","width":1674},{"text":"Okay so the problem is assignment.","width":384},{"text":"Okay so the problem is, assignment is member-wise by default.","width":516},{"text":"Okay, so how do we fix it? We redefine what assignment means. We solve by redefining what assignment that.","width":1056},{"text":"That symbol. Okay if haven't ever seen operator overloading before, I assert that this is not new to you.","width":744},{"text":"Even if you have not heard the phrase operator overloading, I assert that you will not be surprised by it because here is what I think.","width":900},{"text":"I think that if I write code that looks like this. If I say int a, b, c, like this and then I initialize a and b so a equals 37, b equals 63.","width":1402},{"text":"If I say that then that code at the bottom is fine, right?","width":532},{"text":"Yes?","width":133},{"text":"Good.","width":219},{"text":"And moreover, I think you will take an alternative. I think if I say double a equals 37 point something, double b equals 63 point something, you're okay with that too. Right?","width":1417},{"text":"So now, you know that what goes on behind the scenes when that operator is invoked is different in each of these cases. Right? It's a little bit different because doubles are implemented differently than integers, so this plus has to behave differently.","width":1337},{"text":"And it didn't freak you out at all. Right? You're like \"Why is she even talking about this?\"","width":326},{"text":"Well here's another thing that I think won't freak you out. I think it's true that I can say string a equals cat, and string b equals dog.","width":1380}],

So C based lanuages tend to let you chain together assignment operators. And, all we are doing by creating the assignment -- writing the assingment operator is a single chain right here. I'm going to draw a pair of parentheses and see if that helps you come up with a suggestion that might be used to create a chain assignment operator. How could we implement that? How could we make it so that its okay to return values? I have no brain. So I said the answer that I was hoping you would say, so sorry. So notice this is a function call. Right? This is just like b dot operator assignment operator a. If it were to return a value then that value could be the right hand side of C's assignment statement.

How can we ask the question whether or not b and a refer to the same spot in memory? Yes? So if this is not the same as right hand side is almost correct. Help me debug it. What is the right hand side? What kind of thing is the right hand side? It's a sphere. What kind of thing is this? I think i mentioned this very quickly once.

I have a question for you","width":704},{"text":"So this is a sphere class member function, which means when we actually do the implementation we're gonna scope it to the sphere class, much like those are.

Yes?","width":256},{"text":"That's a good thing to notice. ","width":640},{"text":"Yeah, no . You can not. His question is, Why are we doing this?","width":704},{"text":"We already have the destructor and the copy constructor. We have those ? Why aren't we just calling those here.","width":576},{"text":"The reason is because in principle. You are writing those functions for the system to use. They aren't yours","width":640},{"text":"You can't just call them willy-nilly","width":192},{"text":"The indication that is this true. There is no return type. The compiler is expecting you to be calling a function that yields a return type. There is no return type for the destructor and the copy constructor. So you as the coder have no business calling them. On the other hand, you are going to back and change your code for the destructor. The new shiny code for the destructor is simply going to be a call to clear","width":2368},{"text":"The new shiny code for the copy constructor is going to be a call to copy. Okay so, i agree that we shouldn't have the same code in multiple places. I disagree where we should stash it. Yes?","width":1536},{"text":"Um, so the question is.. Whether or not we should. How we should. Wait whether or not we could check for equality instead of inequality. If they are the same then do what. Nothing. So you want the other side. Or whether it wold be single or double assignment operator. If it is a logical question then it is double. I assert that you really don't want to do that. Then you are being explicit about the else.

Who doesn't love spheres?","width":448},{"text":"But we're almost done. We're almost done talking about spheres.","width":320},{"text":"Alright, so we had two classes last time.","width":384},{"text":"One of them was the sphere class. One was the ball class.","width":256},{"text":"Do you remember the way that we described the sphere class in the context of inheritance in C++?","width":448},{"text":"Base class, that's right. So the sphere class is the base class,","width":320},{"text":"Base class... and how about class \"ball\"? It is referred to as the derived class, good.","width":896},{"text":"And, the key thing to observe here is that basically we are exercising code reuse.","width":512},{"text":"That is, if we already have a sphere class, then we can avoid re-implementing a lot of these functions if we just say we intend to use them via inheritance.","width":896},{"text":"So this is largely an issue of code reuse.","width":256},{"text":"Okay, let's see... so there are a few little behaviors that we should talk about.","width":448},{"text":"We talked about them in here a little bit last time, but I didn't get to them for the other class and so I'm going to review them for you as well.","width":704},{"text":"Oh, the other thing that I intended to say here is... from a design-- I want to talk about these two classes in particular from a design perspective for just a second.","width":896},{"text":"Notice that the ball-- a ball-- is a more specific sphere. So it's a sphere with more information.","width":896},{"text":"And furthermore, observe that the functions that are associated with the ball are concerned primarily with that added information.","width":832},{"text":"So from a design perspective, it's reasonable to think about, \"Okay, what's the functionality of the ball as it relates to the data??","width":576},{"text":"That is, what functions do I need in order to make that data accessible, usable, et cetera?","width":448},{"text":"And leave to the sphere class all the functionality that every sphere might need.","width":512},{"text":"And most of those have to do with its data. So it's just sort of a little-- I just wanted to bring it up because there's this little design checklist going on where you can ask yourself, \"Okay I need this function to go here or here\".","width":1024},{"text":"Largely, that decision is made on what kinds of data each of the classes hold.","width":448},{"text":"And how general the use of the function itself is.","width":192},{"text":"Okay, that said, let's be more concrete here. I'm going to declare a sphere, declare a ball. ","width":576},{"text":"Okay, you know what that means. It's certainly okay to declare a sphere because that's just our stupid sphere class that we've been talking about since day one, right?","width":704},{"text":"So it's okay to just declare one of these. Declaring a ball-- also perfectly fine. This is not unlike the image class and the PNG class from MP2, for example.","width":832},{"text":"Alright, now, this assignment statement-- what do you think. Do you like it?","width":384},{"text":"Assume the assignment operator is well-defined.

Yeah so we're well represented here. So Jessica and Victoria want to talk to you about opportunities for, um well, to tell you about reflections projections and how you might participate. Hi I'm in Victoria I'm the chair for reflections projections this year. We have a lot of cool speakers coming in this year between the first and the fourth of October. We also have a programming competition so if want to come build an AI we have awesome prizes, including an Oculus Rift in those. So if you want to come compete and try to win that we'd love to have you. It's October 1 through 4. The programming competition is between the second and third. We have a puzzle competition going on over the course of the event. We also have speakers all of Saturday and some scattered throughout the rest of the event. Two job fairs, one is on Thursday, one is the big job fair on Friday. So if you want to come meet recruiters, see speakers, and maybe compete in a programming competition, come to RP. And here's Jessica to tell you how you can get involved and volunteer. So yeah in addition to experience the event itself, we would love it if some of you or all of you would come help us our during the event. So there is a sign up URL for that, it's www-s.acm.illinois.edu/rpvolunteer. Essentially it's the ACM URL slash rpvolunteer, no special cases, no spaces, just rpvolunteer. If you go there and sign up we will get you fitted for a time slot. And if you volunteer you will be fed, you get food. And you get a free t shirt! Who doesn't love free t shirts. Also food is free for the entire weekend. And it's always good food. OK thanks guys, are you coming back for the next hour? OK nice to see you both. Let's work!

","width":448},{"text":"Alright, I will. Alright, so the abstract base class serves as a prescription for the functionality of any derived class. ","width":1856},{"text":"OK, so in our previous example, where, you know, that we talked about the fact that, uh, we talked about polymorphism. Like a ball could have a display function, but a planet could have a display function as well.","width":1152},{"text":"um, this is a way of saying that every derived class must have a display function and we'll see in a minute, um, an example where that is pretty cool.","width":704},{"text":"Alright, any questions about what you see here neglecting this blue box, the next thing we're gonna talk about is this blue box, so anything, yes?","width":576},{"text":"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes. No, you do not have to use any kind of keyword to overwrite it, you're already saying. Keyword overwrites? No. No.","width":1472},{"text":"No, no, no, no. I do not have to. This is a straightforward simple, nothing else is necessary, OK. Alright, anything else about this?","width":704},{"text":"Yes? Right, yeah we don't have to here. That's right, right. That's right.","width":512},{"text":"OK. Uhh, let's see. So lets talk about how we use this then. You can imagine, well, let's talk about how we use this. Can we use this? Can we declare a flower? No we cant. There shall be no more flowers and the reason for that is simply that","width":1216},{"text":"flower is not a complete class name. Flower is not a finished class. Can we do this?","width":512},{"text":"Sure, of course, right. This is. Now we have all the functionality we need, so this is fine.","width":448},{"text":"How about this one, can we do this. OK? We can still do this one so that might be a little counter intuitive. We can't have a flower, but we can have a flower pointer and the reason for that is we already said that a declaration like this OK.fptr equals new flower.","width":1536},{"text":"And it looks like I only have a default constructor there. OK? Any question about it? Yes?","width":832}],
  [{"text":"Um, so we already, we yes. There's a jump here. You didn't know when I first talked about inheritance why I was telling you that it was ok to have a pointer type on the left. A base class pointer on the left and a derived class pointer on the right. You didn't know where I was going with that, but we did talk about the fact that that was ok. So this assignment is ok because the thing that we're making is a flower. We're building a flower at this point. Right here, I'm sorry, this is wrong. This is wrong, that's why. I almost broke your brains. I am so glad you asked that question! What could I have said that would have not been confusing here? Daisy, very good. Oh my gosh. the whole point of the whole slide was the word that I wrote here, and I screwed it up. Great. Come back next hour, that mistake will not be made, or maybe it should be! maybe I should do that on purpose. Just to see if people are as awake as you. Alright. So, everything I just said is true still, it's still ok to declare a flower pointer, cuz there is no flower constructed there. It would not be ok to say new flow, because we can't build a flower, but we CAN build a daisy. Alright, any questions about this? You should have a question I think. There's no slicing, so we make a daisy, right? Right, so the thing is though, the problem is that once we do this daisy, we don't have access to the daisy specific functionality, but you do have access to any polymorphic function, so when you prescribe what functionality it should have, they're all going to have it anyways because it's virtual, so we can reach it through the flower pointer. Because the functions are declared in the flower. Let's talk about it later, and i encourage you to go experiment. So here's the thing about inheritance, you see it about twice in this class, well maybe three times. We're doing it mostly because you're going to see it in your life, not because you'll see it a lot in data structures in this concert. We're trying to increase your curiosity about it, a little bit of functionality, but not a while lot. I have a question for you, what if i had done this? No, the presence of that = 0 does the same thing. If there's one of the =0, then it is an abstract class. Can I add an equal 0? can I do that? Yes, I can, but the I have no daisy. What this says is that I derive from the daisy class, well is it a Gerber daisy or a freeway daisy?This demands that we be specific about the kind of stem that we draw, apparently. Any questions about it? There may be some sort of reduncy there, in fact I don't think the compiler will let you say =0 without putting virtual  f","width":17258}],
  [{"text":"You only use virtuals if there is a chance that it is a base class.","width":960},{"text":"Furthermore, if your class is available, you do not really know whether it is going to be a base class or not because that is a part of the design. ","width":768},{"text":"Where you can strongly argue that virtual is not necessary, you should eliminate it because it will make faster code.","width":640},{"text":"So use it judiciously. Anyway, so here is an example that I think is really cool. I am going to declare a farm, it is not unlike a garden, but it is a collection of animals. Notice what I can do here. I can use this pointer to represent an array. When I instantiate it I can declare it with square brackets to make a dynamic array.","width":2432},{"text":"And I can let every element be of type animal pointer, each of which can then be instantiated with a different derived animal.

It is an array where the things are not necessarily the same.

The polymorphic behavio","width":832},{"text":"The polymorphic behavior and the ability to insist that that function be defined means that we can demand that each of those classes has a speak function and that they are instantiated in a class specific way. So what happens for this for loop? You get 'barf, oink, nay, moo, quack'.","width":1664},{"text":"Alright, so we already talked a little bit about the fact that inheritance gives you this polymorphic behavior at the significant cost to performance, because at compile time the system has to look at the code and see what kinds of things might require this polymorphic behavior, and it has to build the machine code for all of it. So that makes for bloated machine code. Now that is called dynamic polymorphism, where you might not know at the compilation of your code what kinds of things this will be instantiated with and you do not need to know it. So that comes at a performance cost.","width":4928},{"text":"There is another kind of polymorphism that because of this performance issue was introduced into the language a little bit later. It is implemented via this construct called templates.","width":1152},{"text":"And it is a kind of polymorphism where all of the type dependent information is known at compile time. So there is no ambiguity and there is no need to build in this flexibility at compile time.","width":1216},{"text":"So that is our next topic. Templates. I have some code. Here is my main. I am using some integers and some characters and I have got these two functions that swap them. There are my two functions. What do you notice about the code. There are 2 germane points to be made.","width":2048}],
  [{"text":"Yes?","width":201},{"text":"Yes very good.","width":96},{"text":"So err the code is identical except for type information.","width":857},{"text":"Okay what else do you notice about this code? Yeah. You.","width":664},{"text":"Very good. Yep. It actually doesn't do anything!","width":384},{"text":"Neither function actually does anything.","width":760},{"text":"Okay and how could I fix that. I will fix that one first. How could I fix that? Pass by reference. Very good. Don't say pointer to me.","width":692},{"text":"Alright, good.","width":247},{"text":"So let's talk about the first point in a little bit more detail.","width":405},{"text":"So this is fine, right, to have these two functions that do pretty much the same thing. ","width":323},{"text":"In fact if somebody were asking you to include these two functions in an mp you go 'oh yay they're about the same I can cut and paste'. ","width":489},{"text":"I can cut and paste my solution from one and I got the other one done. Yes, right?","width":299},{"text":"The problem is that then you have to go back through and kinda check and make sure that your type information is updated correctly.","width":576},{"text":"Now the compiler's gonna help you mostly with those kinds of bugs but it's still a pain in the neck.","width":384},{"text":"And in fact if somebody, if somebody came down and said 'there is new technology for swapping'.","width":629},{"text":"Okay? Unlikely to happen but it could. ","width":218},{"text":"Somebody came down and said there is new technology for swapping.","width":258},{"text":"Drawback of doing it this way is that you have to go find all of these little swap functions and change them, right, to take advantage of this new swap algorithm.","width":881},{"text":"Okay. Yes it's artificial but. Alright so code reuse is important for maintenance and incremental improvement of codes. Okay?","width":829},{"text":"And we admit here that look they are about the same.","width":165},{"text":"So how on earth are we going to unify those two functions into one thing but still allow for type information to be err recorded in the code?","width":907},{"text":"And the answer is that c++ provides syntax for passing as a parameter hah my gosh type information, type information into the function.","width":919},{"text":"Okay? Alright, so how does this work?","width":273},{"text":"I have my same main except that I'm writing a single swap function.","width":504},{"text":"The way we, the way we tell the system exactly how we want swap to work is we have this alternative syntax for, alternative syntax for parameterizing type,","width":1085},{"text":"and we put it between angle brackets.","width":108},{"text":"So first you have the type parameters and then you have the value parameters, okay?","width":377},{"text":"Similarly here we would do char.","width":264},{"text":"And I'll tell you right now that if you forget to do this, when the compiler can it will infer it for you.","width":599},{"text":"So sometimes it's not the case that you'll see those angle brackets even for a templated class.","width":453},{"text":"Okay so the system can infer it , it will.","width":181},{"text":"Okay.","width":64},{"text":"So now that's how you use these template functions, how do you define them?","width":326},{"text":"Well you prepend the function signature above the, above the first line it becomes the first line with this keyword template.","width":695},{"text":"This is a keyword.","width":237},{"text":"Class which is also a keyword but it could be typename instead.","width":742}],

We want to exploit the fact that this chain of memory all linked together is a listNode pointer instantiated with the listNode together with another chain that looks just the same, that is just a smaller instance of the original problem. This situation begs for recursion, that's right. Any time you can break a structure down into something that is smaller than the original but has the same characteristics of the original, you're talking about a recursively defined structure.

  [{"text":"of a data structure.

Grocery list, the list of classes you go to, any collection of things where you care about their positions.","width":768},{"text":"Now, heres the cool thing about the abstract data type for the list class, and in fact for any abstract data type that we will study. C++ puts the abstract data type into the class definition, the public section of the class definition.","width":1280},{"text":"So, the cool thing is, if I asked you about the functionality of your general notion of a list, you could point to the header file, point to the class definition contained in the header file and say look, I can create you a list, that's part of its functionality, I can tell you the size of the list, you can insert new things into it in a particular spot, you can remove things from a particular spot, and you can return the data contained in a particular spot.","width":2496},{"text":"And that right there, this is the ADT for a general list. Operative word there is list. And the only reason i say general there is to distinguish it from what we thing of as a linked list.","width":1216},{"text":"This is not necessarily a linked list. Okay, notice that we can use this list, this abstract data type list, by simply looking at the public section for it, and I get to keep this secret. I don't have to tell you what data is associated with the list, i just have to promise you that i will fulfill that functionality.","width":1984},{"text":"that I will implement that abstract data type. Okay? Alright, so fine, lets get a feel for what these lists are by walking through a little bit of client code, designed to illustrate the fact that we can be functional without having to know about the implementation.","width":1280},{"text":"So the first thing we do is we initialize the thing, it is a list containing integers, that's good. And now I'm just going to use it. I'm going to insert into the first position number 4. Here is my list.","width":1280},{"text":"I'm just going to put it right here. I'm just going to put my list right here, the front of the list is on this side.","width":503},{"text":"And now I'm going to insert into the first position number 6 and now where is 4? The second position, right? You are moving things down. It's sort of like you have a list of favorite movies and you see a better movie, its not like your previous best movie disappears, rather it moves to your second best movie. And that's just how a list class is supposed to function.","width":1984},{"text":"And now I'm going to insert 8 into the front of the list. Okay. Then I am going to insert into the third position, value 0.","width":903},{"text":"Okay, so I think i put it right here. Yes? And then I will insert into the fourth position, the get item number 2, so in the end it should look something like this. And it should be sort of opaque to you what actually happened in memory when scratching out and moving around happened. That's all encapsulated away.","width":2321},{"text":"Alright, and then I want to Cout the size, we better get 5 here. I want to remove the second thing. And then i want to get the third thing, so this should give us 6. Okay?","width":1143},{"text":"So this list is really an ordered collection of items. Ordered...","width":821}],

Got any problems with that array?","width":576},{"text":"It can't get any bigger that's right. It's a static array and you know what? That one even won't hold your to-do list.","width":512},{"text":"Probably. It would hold my grocery list but it would not hold your to-do list. It's too small.

The number of valid things in the list.

","width":192},{"text":"And that's the implementation. Any questions about it? ","width":320},{"text":"So notice what I'm neglecting here. I'm neglecting kind of what to do about the fact that some lists are longer. ","width":768},{"text":"We are gonna handle that in a couple different ways over the course of the next week or so. ","width":320},{"text":"But we that said, I want to talk about a little bit of a technical detail even if we used an array to implement an ordered collection of things. ","width":896},{"text":"Try to ignore for the moment the fact that this is a fixed size. We are still gonna look at the use of an array of any kind assume it's big enough in this context.

","width":320},{"text":"So I think you have a clear picture in your mind and I probably don't have it in mine. But it suffices to say it would be more complex.

  [{"text":"It does this and it does this. so what are you thinking, it kinda looks like? it's got. yes? yes! exactly those operators are overloaded inside the iterator class. that's what the iterator class does, it overloads those operators so that you can do, can work this magic. now the question was, why don't you do this instead and the answer is that that would require that to be overloaded and i'm not sure if it actually is for this standard template library list class. i just don't know ok. um iterators promise that the plus plus will be overloaded and that the asterisk will be overloaded so you can both move this thing and look inside your structure. that is a promise from an iterator k? this is a good time to say uhh where that promise came from like it's a promise but who said, who said thats a promise?

So what is an iterator, anybody you talk to about c++ will know what an iterator is.

Nathan? Yeah? right. So how do you know you're overloading dereference, or multiplication and the answer is in the number of arguments, so when you dereference, so remember that a function is in part declared by its parameters, i can have two functions of the same name but if they are parameterized differently, then they are different functions, and the same thing is true for dereference operators. it has one and in fact in this case, effectively there are no arguments, it is just the thing. K. and instead of the binary operator. Yeah? could i accomplish this same thing with primitive types? not nearly so elegantly right? So i could do this if i implemented my own list class with a dynamic array and made it but so i could do this in C is sort of what you're asking me basically right? but i wouldn't want to. i wouldn't want to, this is one of the elegances,  elegancies from having C++ ok? Alright any other questions about this right now? ok alright. so uhh, my question is for you, is what is printed out? this is cout, this is the contents of our list, what is printed out? k so the names so we get giraffe, and leaves, and then the next time through we get penguin, and fish and then... do you?

Any questions for him? alright. thank you very much. yeah. *claps* that is the cheapest applause you're ever gonna get. ok alright fine, um did anybody have any other speculation on what this function does or any other description they'd like to add to it? so what i want to know next is what what is printer? what is printer? now yeah? it's a functor what the heck is that that's a new word. that's a new word, he said its a functor, i just wanna say it a few times because its so fun to say. try it. functor. that's right. good. ok. in fact that's correct, in fact that's correct, ok. now. but, there's a little bit of ambiguity but i asked the question for a reason. what is printer look like in a the middle of the function there? what is it look like, it looks like a function right? it is applied to some parameters right? with parenthesis so it looks like a function but where did it come from. it came in as an object, it came in as a parameter to the function so in fact, printer is what we call a function object. AKA say it, thank you. also known as a functor ok? alright any questions about that. alright fine well all of that is quite abstract, right? all of it is quite abstract so lets make it a little bit more in the context of this function, so lets make it a bit more concrete. the question is how do we make a functor? what is a functor? well take a look at this code right here, take a look at this code what does it do? overloads the parentheses operator, very good and that's it. that's all it does. it overloads the parentheses operator to do a little tricky function, a little cute function, ok? fine. now but it's a class so we can declare something of that type so the first thing i want you to do is remember the previous example declare something of type animal. anybody want to come up here and do this on my tablet for me? ok how about verbally tell me what to do. how do i declare something of type animal? you remember ? from last time. you know the struct is behind here, you can almost see, oh look look look, right here, you can see it. k? alright who wants to do this, raise your hand. somebody raise their hand, ok close your eyes and raise your hand. close your eyes and now raise your hand. chickens, you bunch of chickens. animals c is a chicken and if you remember its a big chicken that eats you. you right k. ok! so i declared an animal, now printigbig is a class, which means i can declare something of that type right? yes? right i can cover over all of this and it says class printifbig, it's not templatized or anything so i can say, printifbig ","width":20928}],

  [{"text":"The trees, TL and TR, and are they binary trees? Yes! Because they are empty, right? Look. It's there's like an empty tree there and an empty tree there. So this recursion sorta feel sane to us. What if I erased um..This leg. If I erased 5, and asked you to consider this binary tree. Do you like it? Is it ok? Does it feel like a binary tree? Sure, it's a root together with left and right subtrees. The left subtree has some substance and the right subtree is...is empty. So we're OK. Alright, any questions about that recursive definition? OK, well...Uh...Let's see. So we're going to write functions on these structures and these functions can come in lots of different forms and in fact the data contained in this...The data contained in this particular example tells you about one of the functions you can write on binary trees. What does that data look like? What does that data remind you of? Can you imagine? Computation, right. Evaluation of an expression, that's right. So, in fact, you can imagine that every subtree is like a parenthesized phrase, right. So this triangle has parenthesis around it, this one has parenthesis around it. The whole thing has parenthesis. So this is an example of an expression tree and if we know how to get around on this structure, using say...Traversal. Then we may have a good way of evaluating such a structure. But we're not doing that right now. Okay. Alright, so let's write some functions on this structure. The first one we're going to write is height. Now, you guys talked about height last time, right? What's wrong? We didn't...Mattox and I didn't get a chance to talk beforehand and so the definition that he used is a different one then we're going to use. Okay? So, the definition of height that we're going to use in our class is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. Okay? So what does that mean about the height of that tree? What's the height of that tree? Height here is 3, good. 1, 2, 3. Okay? Path length is number of steps or number of edges. Okay, that's all good and fine. Uh, what is the height of here's this example. What is the height of this tree? What's the height of that tree? Zero, very good. And what's the height of five's left subtree? This is where there's a problem. We should all be going gulp I don't know. gulp I don't know. Alright, let's talk about it a minute. Alright, so given a height, given a tree T a recursive definition of the height of T. Alright, so this is what I think is true. The height of T is one plus the maximum height. This is what you did last time. H E I G H T of TL and height of TR. Right? Nothing's different than last time. The problem is...The problem is what's the height of an empty tree? So if I draw you a picture of an empty tree, what's it's height? I drew you a picture of an empty tree, see it? It's lovely isn't it, it is both the most beautiful and the ugliest tree you've ever seen. Right? It's an empty tree. So what's the height of the longest path from the root to a leaf? Uh...uhh...What path? What path? OK. So there is no root, there is no leaf, there is no path. It's completely indetermenant. So we can choose any height we want. Now. Because we can have empty trees it makes sense to choose a height for that empty-ness, the absence, to be something that makes sense. Okay? Does something that helps us out mathematically. Well, you were already whispering what helps us out mathematically. It is the solution that gives us a zero for a single node tree. And it is, what is it? Negative one, that's right. So the height of an empty tree is negative one. tree? What's the height of that tree? Height here is 3, good. 1, 2, 3. Okay? Path length is number of steps or number of edges.
