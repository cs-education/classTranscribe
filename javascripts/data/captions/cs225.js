So that kind of connects the story back and forth.

Alright. Did that hurt? And you weren't ready for that at all. We didn't talk about that ahead of time. I don't even know your name.","width":640},{"text":"Alright. Ok so the metaphor here, in case you're missing it, is that not only can we be clever with the mechanism","width":1088},{"text":"we use to search our data. We can be clever with the mechanism we use to arrange our data in the first place.","width":576},{"text":"Now the real question is if you're looking for your purple long sleeve button down.","width":448},{"text":"Would you rather look for it in this closet or in this closet?","width":384},{"text":"Yeah, obviously.","width":512},{"text":"Alright, all you do is go the the button downs and it's right there. Right?","width":192},{"text":"Where this one you do your back linear search.","width":256},{"text":"Alright so, our algorithms and our arrangement of data in memory are two things.","width":512},{"text":"And it's the whole course. Any questions or comments?","width":320},{"text":"Ok what's it like? Eh, you can read that later.","width":320},{"text":"It's a puzzle solving course.

I don't want to know. Alright.","width":384},{"text":"Where did you come from? So I think that many of you can raise your hand if your introductory course, your prerequisite course is 125. ","width":576},{"text":"That corresponds a lot to the CS majors a probably minors.","width":192},{"text":"Raise your hand--ah this is so hard. I cannot remember what the prerequisite course is for ECE. Which one is it?","width":576},{"text":"Did that hurt?","width":128},{"text":"To talk to me? Ok.","width":128},{"text":"Alright. And what's your name? Matt, ok. Thank you.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. So it is 220. Good alright. That's the prerequisite course.","width":512},{"text":"Now the amazing thing is that you guys in 220. You people in 220 learn everything you need to know about C.","width":576},{"text":"And that means things like pointers and memory and being responsible with your memory.","width":768},{"text":"And if you came from CS 125 it means that you know everything that there is to know about objects.","width":768},{"text":"Well guess what, in this course we seek to unify. And so we're going to use C++. And the dated version for a very deliberate reason.","width":640},{"text":"We're gunna use C++ and the cool thing about it is that there is a little something in for everybody.","width":512},{"text":"C++ has pointers, that is we control our memory at a lower level.","width":512},{"text":"But it's also object oriented. ","width":384}],
  [{"text":"Now, if you know everything there is to know about pointers, I'd still suggest that you use that as a springboard to learn, perhaps a little bit new, how C++ deals with memory a little differently, at least syntactically, from C. So you will still not want to disengage, you will still want to be disengaged with the idiosyncratic differences between C and C++.  And now, in the previous sentences replace pointers with objects and the same is true for those of you who came from 125.  Even if you already know about objects, you will find new idiosyncratic things in C++ that you should learn about. So, these two things even though parts of them are familiar, as a whole they will be slightly different.  My take will be, my emphasis will be to differentiate C++ from your previous experiences.  So I'm going to assume that you know for loops, variable assignment, function calling, I really am going to assume that you have had the introductory course, cruise right on past that basic stuff (conditionals, what) cruise right on past that basic stuff and into the ways that it differs, and the ways that it will serve us in learning about data structures.  Any questions?  Alright.  Let's work.  So, the first c++ - and I have 15 minutes - can we find - 13 minutes - we're going to get a ton of stuff done. Because you already know a lot of what I'm about to tell you.  You already know it.  You already know that when you declare and define a variable in your prerequisite language that it has the following characteristics.  You might not have thought about it explicitly before.  But I'm pretty sure it won't surprise you when I tell you every variable has a name, and a value, and in our languages of choice, it has a type, and they have memory locations.  That is the value of this variable is stored someplace.  Okay?  Any of that surprise you?  Alright.  So, uh, like these other languages C++ has some primitive types.  These are things that you can look up.  We make a declaration in c++- for completeness you can look them up.  We make a declaration in c++ in a way that won't surprise you.  If I want a boolean I'm gonna call it a bool.  Cat.  Like this.  Okay?  So I declare the variable - what's the variable name?  Cat.  What's it's type?  Boolean.  What's its value?  This is tricky.  What's its value?  Okay.  Anytime you ask what's its value and there isn't an automatic known everybody answers the same thing we're all sure we're all on the same page, then what you have to think is it is garbage.  It absolutely has no value.  Now, it's true, that some c++ compilers will stick in, you know, a default value for you.  But, we're never going to rely on that.  We're always going to assume it is garbage until we give it, until we explicitly give it the value that we want it to have. so, oftentimes, these primitive types will be accompanied by an assignment statement much like this.  So that statement is equivalent char rating; rating = 'E';.  We can do them both in one go.  Any question about it?  Okay, fine.","width":5120}],
  [{"text":"so bad it's, uhh. So bad... It's good. Okay, The key thing to notice there is sometimes if you don't include your decimal to reinforce the fact that you're not dealing with integers, the compiler will yell at you.","width":1280.4},{"text":"So, you know, that is the shortcutting a ton of ridiculous debugging time right there. ","width":320.4},{"text":"All right, any questions about that?","width":192.4},{"text":"No. Here is what I think. I think you should be sleeping. Kuhh, we had known about variable declaration for at least a semester now. ","width":576.4},{"text":"So, here is where things get a little bit more interesting. ","width":256.4},{"text":"It turns out that the set of primitive types of things we can use to declare variables is not enough.","width":384.4},{"text":" In many many almost all circumstances, in fact, we want to define our own types to use as the bases for declaring variables.","width":704.4},{"text":"Okay? In C that was structs; in JAVA it was classes and in C++ it is classes.","width":384.4},{"text":"Alright, so here's what we gonna talk about next.","width":192.4},{"text":"User defined types in C++, those are classes.","width":512.4},{"text":"Okay? And I will show you the syntax for defining a class in just a minute because I wanna start with how do you use a class once it is defined and available to you.","width":704.4},{"text":"Well, you use it.","width":128.4},{"text":"This is different. This is different than in JAVA.","width":128.4},{"text":"You use it just like you do a primitive type and, in fact, a software engineering principle says that when you write a class, you create a type that can be used just as if it is a primitive type.","width":960.4},{"text":"It is sort of one of the standards for completeness.","width":128.4},{"text":"Okay? Alright, so if it's just like a primtive type and if my class name is sphere, then I declare a variable of type \"sphere\" using this statement.","width":896.4},{"text":"Any question about it? ","width":64.4},{"text":"So now I have a sphere. ","width":64.4},{"text":"We don't yet know what a sphere is.","width":192.4},{"text":"We gonna define the class later on.","width":256.4},{"text":"For now, I just want you to see how to declare one. ","width":192.4},{"text":"Okay, so, a class is a group of two things...","width":704.4},{"text":"It is a group of a variables and functions.","width":512.4},{"text":"Now, these two words, which I will refer to as variables and functions, in other languages may have different ways being refer to.","width":704.4},{"text":"So, we may have fields, here sometimes instead of variables.","width":320.4},{"text":"We might call them member variables and I will always do that actually, almost always do that if I rememering that they are called member variables.","width":512.4},{"text":"Uh,  and functions, functions are always refered to as... methods, very good.","width":768.4},{"text":"And for those of you who came from C, the classes is not very different from a struct except for this part.","width":960.4},{"text":"Okay? a class is not very different from a struct except for this part.","width":192.4},{"text":"Any questions?","width":128.4},{"text":"And I will show you how to use that part very soon.","width":128.4},{"text":"Not quite yet, I don't think","width":128.4},{"text":"One of the things that ran wrong this morning was that the printer was broken and so, I don't have my class notes.","width":512.4},{"text":"So we are a kind of winging it.","width":64.4},{"text":"you've probably noticed.","width":192.4},{"text":"Alright, so here we go.","width":128.4},{"text":"Let's define a class.","width":64.4},{"text":"Okay?","width":128.4},{"text":"Now, here is the skeleton, here is the skeleton.","width":192.4},{"text":"Uh, we simply define class \"sphere\" [use] opening and close brackets to declare a block of code and what is different from what you've seen before is that we do have to include a semicolon in this case after the class definition.","width":1344.4},{"text":"And the reason for that is because there is a field right there that we don't use.","width":256.4},{"text":"Okay? But it exists in the language definition and so we have to end that statement.","width":384.4},{"text":"There's like this \"ghost\"  statement here.","width":128.4},{"text":"Okay?","width":64.4},{"text":"So, another common mistake to make is to forget that semicolon because it feels redundant.","width":384.4},{"text":"Feels like I put a closed bracket there and it must think I'm done with my class definition but you are not.","width":384.4},{"text":"Okay, so, well, uh, here we go.","width":384.4}],
  [{"text":"The members are the collection of both variables and functions.","width":929},{"text":"And in the class definition itself, we declare our intent to define.","width":722},{"text":"Now, what that means is that we won't actually see any function definitions inside the class definition.","width":610},{"text":"So this is already different from Java, because in Java your class definitions are that long sometimes, right?","width":465},{"text":"In C++ not so much because we just make a list of the things we intend to define, rather than explicitly defining all of them.","width":691},{"text":"So now, in this class definition, we allow for our little control freakiness stuff to come out.","width":628},{"text":"There are two regions inside the class definitions that we use to control access to the members.","width":583},{"text":"And those regions are specified by a public keyword and a private keyword.","width":768},{"text":"Public keyword and a private keyword.","width":227},{"text":"And public is anything you want the user of the class to see.","width":1071},{"text":"Now who's the user of the class, it's whoever did this, it's whoever made the declaration.","width":635},{"text":"Private, though, is what you want to control.","width":242},{"text":"Two purposes to private.","width":113},{"text":"One, you want to control access because you don't want a calling function, you want to control the calling function changes your data associated with the thing. ","width":743},{"text":"That's one reason.","width":81},{"text":"And two, actually, I can think of another reason, two, you don't want to expose to the calling function the way you have implemented something.","width":704},{"text":"And three, you want some special place that you can put your utility code that nobody can mess with, that nobody needs to see.","width":832},{"text":"So these are usually the following things: the data of associated with the class object, and those are the variables that I referred to on the other page.","width":1487},{"text":"But also, functionality that only the class itself needs.","width":492},{"text":"And we won't worry about that for a while.","width":640},{"text":"Okay, so I made a big stink out of the fact that the class definition includes only declarations for all of the members.","width":1024},{"text":"And then the question is, well where does the actual implementation go, where does the code go?","width":363},{"text":"And the answer is, in a separate file.","width":283},{"text":"We actually implement all the functions in a separate place.","width":298},{"text":"That allows us to kinda keep the value of our implementations, to not show the world how clever we are, because we're going to bank on it.

Now the question is how do we make that happen? The answer is to define a class whose name is sphere.","width":640},{"text":"The details of defining a class are like this","width":256},{"text":"You understand that there is this public access system, but you don't necessarily know what that means","width":446},{"text":"And a private area in the class definition","width":192},{"text":"You don't know yet what that implies, and that's okay.","width":256},{"text":"Then you go to the drawing board and you think, okay, what kind of functionality do you want from a sphere and how do you represent a sphere.","width":704},{"text":"That is, what data do we need to umm keep about a sphere. So when we talk about the representation.","width":576},{"text":"What we're really talking about is what data will characterize anything of class sphere.","width":176},{"text":"So ... raise your hand if you have an idea of data that will characterize a sphere.","width":429},{"text":"Yeah? Whether it is round or not. Guess what? We're going to implement it so that it is round","width":459},{"text":"Okay? Sphere will be round","width":128},{"text":"Okay? That is just... we'll make that happen","width":182},{"text":"Yes, so if I tell you something is a sphere and I give you its radius","width":384},{"text":"You know what that sphere is, right?","width":192},{"text":"There is only one sphere that has that radius... well, sorta","width":327},{"text":"We're going to use ... uhhh ... radius ... oh wait","width":500},{"text":"Could I use diameter instead?","width":128},{"text":"Yes, could I use surface area instead?","width":407},{"text":"That would be crazy, but yeah, because you'd have to take square root.","width":549},{"text":"How about volume? Could I use volume instead of radius to characterize my sphere?","width":384},{"text":"Is there only one sphere with volume ... whatever?","width":338},{"text":"Now, again, we are in a design discussion. Why wouldn't I use those?","width":355},{"text":"Why wouldn't I use those other things?","width":192},{"text":"Yeah? Yeah, they induce time to evaluate, right?","width":512},{"text":"Like if the only thing I care about about a sphere is its volume, then I might use its volume","width":406},{"text":"But probably, for a general purpose sphere, I can most quickly get to what I want by keeping its radius, and doing simple arithmetic","width":667},{"text":"Simple arithmetic in every direction to get the data, or the information that I want from it.","width":394},{"text":"So I'm not going to keep... you're going to have to forgive all the slide switching. That is my fist on the ... thing.","width":502},{"text":"I'm going to keep the radius. Okay? That's going to be my representative. ","width":448},{"text":"Now, the reason why we keep the radius instead of the volume, say, is taking cube roots is expensive computationally. Okay? So that's the piece of it...that is... that's the piece of it that's hard. That's why we decide on radius","width":923},{"text":"Whereas cubing something ... not expensive at all.","width":320},{"text":"Who knew? You thought they were uhhh you thought they were inverses of each other. You didn't care. We care.","width":461},{"text":"Okay, so now we know how to represent this beach ball.

  [{"text":"So, alright. We are going to keep sphere and denote it by its radius. What do we want to do with the spheres? So, once I have beach ball here, what do I need to be able to do with it? yeah? I might want to get the diameter from it. That's right. I might want to get information about it. I might want to get information about sphere. Anything else? I might want to do? yeah? I might want to change it. That's right. I might want to change information about it. I might want to change the radius. ugh, change it. OK? And, the last one is kinda implicit, and I already done it. We might want to create a new one. If you are coming from Java, this basically constitutes a collection of geters and seters right? We need to get information and change information. In C++, we do that ourselves explicitly. We don't just get ask for them. So, we are going to write the code to do it. Now, before we write the code to actually implement it, these things, we declare them. Now, here is the story, for the representation in practice, we are always going to put the declaration of the member variable, that's what those are, in the private section, cause we want to controll the access. Talk about that more in a second. So, in the private section of our class defination, I am going to write double theRadius. And now, I am going to use my functionality list, as essentially a checklist for the declarations of the functions I am going to implement. To declare the class defination. So, one two and three there are my checklist, and I am going to go through there, and start to declaring functions, achieve that functionality. OK? alright. So, the first thing I want to do is get information. If I am getting information from the thing, then I better have a return type. Better have a way to accepting the information. Ugh, what I am going to do is, oh, sorry, erasing, hmm. oh, no.. What I am going to do is, to have a function, with return type is double, whose name is get, probably one of these for radius,  diameter, volume and surface area. But the one I am going to use for an example is get diameter. There are no parameters to that function, and the declaration, ends with semicolon. And I will show you how to use that function that has no parameters in just a sec. Now, we are done with get information. Now, what does it look like when we want to chage one of these things? Well, we don't expect a return type, we might have a boolean in there to see weather we have been successful. The name of it might be setRadius(), and this time, we do want a parameter. We are going to pass setRadius, a double, whose name is newRadius. Hey, again, it is a declaration, and it ends with a semicolon. It is just a statement of my intend to imple","width":16384},{"text":"ment.

So we have to go through setRadius to change the radius.","width":320},{"text":"Alright. Yes","width":320},{"text":"You don't need a constructor to create the object.","width":192},{"text":"The system will provide one for you, but it's a really really stupid one.","width":256},{"text":"So you probably want to create your own.

Okay fine, I am not too surprised about that.","width":704},{"text":"Anything else here? Yes, okay look at, this wasn't here. You can look back - I didn't do that when I declared this here. So that's different, I'm gonna talk about it in a minute.","width":1152},{"text":"Okay, what else looks weird here? What else looks unfamiliar?","width":448},{"text":"What the heck is the double colon about?","width":320},{"text":"Okay, that's called a scope resolution operator.","width":320},{"text":"And here's what that says. That says that this setRadius is the setRadius declared in the sphere class.","width":1280},{"text":"It's not the one declared in the circle class.","width":192},{"text":"It's not the one declared in the arm class.","width":384},{"text":"You get it?","width":128},{"text":"Doesn't your arm have a radius? Yes, okay.","width":256},{"text":"Like if you have a broken arm, you set the radius, right?","width":448},{"text":"Fine.","width":64},{"text":"Tough crowd.","width":128},{"text":"Okay fine, so this setRadius is the one associated with the sphere class. So if you saw something here that was attached via the scope resolution operator to another class, it's not the one you are interested in. Okay.","width":960},{"text":"I am not going to talk about const yet, I'll talk about it in a minute. Suffice to say that the scope resolution operator attaches, or associates, a function to a class.","width":960},{"text":"Alright, so let's set the radius.","width":320},{"text":"What code do you think we would have to do if somebody tells you \"here's a new radius\".

Remind me to talk about that again before I advance the slide. Alright.","width":1472},{"text":"Yes?","width":192},{"text":"Yeah, I might want to because what this allows right now is I can say bball.setRadius(-4.7). Right? And so this is our chance, our opportunity to do some error handling here.","width":1664},{"text":"So maybe I might want to say","width":128},{"text":"If newRad is greater than zero do this, otherwise theRadius - what should be a default radius?","width":1088},{"text":"Yeah?","width":384},{"text":"Yeah maybe one","width":128},{"text":"Or just leave it. Don't make a change, but then you'd want to tell somebody you are doing that. In any case, this is not exactly how you handle errors.","width":640},{"text":"Alright, so I want to make a comment here. In this class, we are not going to talk a lot about exception handling.","width":512},{"text":"Okay?","width":64},{"text":"We have too much to do, and so, we are not a software engineering class, so.","width":512},{"text":"C++ has mechanisms for exception handling. You can Google them.

How are object oriented programming languages typically characterized? Now what you will know is that there a lot of different ways of characterizing object oriented programming languages.

So, these circles represent code for a class definition, consider a single class at this point, we've already said that we separate into a header file and implementation file. So the example is sphere.cpp and sphere.h and the vocabulary we use for that .h is interface because I can give you a .h file and you know how to use the class, you don't need the .cpp to get everything you need from the .h file. Now what are all these little blue bubbles? That one is my neighbor Virginia. Here is the main that I happen to use. Maddox came to my office, said hey you got a sphere I can use? I said sure, here's the idea. HEre's what encapsulation gets for you. It allows you to make it so that all these clients can do their business looking only at the interface and it can build a wall , demands that a wall is build between the clients and the implementation. The client can see everything they need to know about the interface and don't need to worry about the implementation. Any questions? It streamlines the communication about these classes at exactly the right level of abstraction. The substance of today is actually memory.

This one is a memory leak it was just like the very first memory leak picture we did. This one is incidious because everything here works fine but its probably not what you intended. Anytime you refer to memory that has been deleted you have a problem. And then this is the last one I wanted to ask everyone to think about very quickly. Let me ask you a question. Is there a type mismatch anywhere? Do you see a type mismatch? Is everything ok type wise? Yes because if you dereference p the result is an integer. So across this assignment statement you have an integer on the right and an integer on the left. So is this box fine? No its not fine, why not? Yea p doesnt have any memory associated with it and you dereferenced it. So that's going to give you a seg fault. Alright any questions about any of that? Alright is a type mismatch a compile time or runtime error, that is am I going to get that error when I invoke clang on my system or am i going to get that error when I invoke a.out. Clang, this is a compiler error, those are the easy ones. Ok how about the bottom right box, compiler error or runtime error am i going to see that when i invoke clang or when i invoke the output file a.out. Yea this is a runtime error. That's unfortunate, you don't even know about it until someone is using your software. using your application. OK the problem with the first two is that they are both runtime errors with no notification. You need to be using debugging tools to even find them.

What happens to the pointer p and we talked about the fact that it can be reassigned.

Take a couple minutes and look at the code and tell me how are they different functionally what do they do differently. Main functions are identical. You can assume that string is a standard type.

  [{"text":"The address of w. okay? The address of w and then, so, this right here, this eventually becomes the address of w.  This function call is sort of replaced by return value. Right? In the flow of the program. Then we assign it the value of d. Is this syntactically in type wise correct?","width":726},{"text":"Is work okay type wise? Yes, it does. 'd' is a student pointer 'w', this is the address of the student, those are the same thing. So type wise this works fine.  But let me ask you this.  What happens to 'w,' the second we leave the function? What happens to 'w'? Yeah? That's right!  The system does you a favor.  It clears the right off the stack.  Boom boom done.  Right? So 's' and 'w' are effectively gone because they were local to the function.  So what about the address of 'w'?  How do you feel about the address of 'w' out here in the calling code? Daaah!  Right? It's no longer valid!  Now will it work? Will this code work?  Most of the time, maybe? It's probabilistic thing.  You are rolling your die here.  So, the point of which this assignment is made, the point of which this assignment is made relies on the 'w' that is no longer in scope.  So, but, 'w' is not in scope.  So this is a horrific bug.  Why is it horrific?  It's worse than insidious.  Why is it horrific?  Because it might work a lot of the time you probably won't get a seg fault.  Another parts of, other times, you might get a seg fault, other times you would just get a value that you don't understand because that stack has been reassigned to be something else by some other process. Okay?  Alright.  So what was the error here?  What did we do wrong?  What did we do wrong here?  Yes?  We used stack and we returned what from the stack?  A memory address of something on the stack.  That's right.  We returned the memory address of stack variable.  Now returning that thing by value would have been fine.  Returning 'w' by value would have been perfectly fine.  So if 'd' were instead just a student and we had just returned 'w' here, then things would have worked fine.  That's returning by value, yes?  So the address is memory address.  It's the location in memory.  And, we returned it because there's nothing that says we can't return something of pointer type.  Right? We returned it pointer type.  So that types match up across this assignment statement.  This is pointer, this is pointer.  No problem.  Right?  Except that the thing that we instantiated that pointer with that, is, ephemeral, kind of.  Alright, any question about it?  Is it okay?  Alright.  That's the, that's the warning.  Don't return a local variable memory address, local variable's memory address.  Okay fine.  Uh, let's do something else.  Return by value would've worked fine here.  Returning a student would have worked fine.  Let's do something else.  Uh, let's talk here about... How would you describe that?  What have we done here in this function?  Are we returning a student?","width":1826}],
  [{"text":"Sort of.. what does that ampersand mean in that case? By reference, that's right. So our intention is to return a student by reference. Okay? Now we'll trace what that means here. Okay, so the setup in this case, oh brother, um here's C: cat, squigly, false. Um here's D: ok? its not initialized, we haven’t taken great pains to initialize it. When we call the function, C goes in as the parameter, S becomes a copy of it on the stack. We create a new one, W, it becomes of that, also on the stack. Okay any questions so far? We mess around with W, we mess around with W, and then we return it by reference. First of all--first question: is there a type mismatch? Oh, it looks like there is, doesn’t it? Is there a type mismatch? The answer is no. It looks like there is, but that ampersand in that context does not mean memory address, mostly. It doesn’t really refer to memory address, it doesn’t mean pointer. It means a reference. What’s the difference? The difference is..the difference is that behind the scenes, pointers are being passed around. But here, in the code, you can refer to everything by its student, by its student value. The dereferencing that happens is all done automatically for you. And in fact, you probably shouldn’t even think about it as a pointer, just think about it as a student. Now, what happens in this case? W is passed back by reference and this thing right here, the return value of this, the right hand side of this assignment statement becomes essentially another name for W. So this is now the right hand side token, whatever the system decides to use for the return value of that token. Right here, this is another name for W. Kay.. and then we do an assignment statement. We assign that to D. Do you like it? Do you like it? Raise your hand if you like it or you see no reason not to. Raise your hand if you can’t-if you can't stand it. If you detest it. Raise your hand if you’re somewhere in the middle. Okay. Good. Why do you detest it? Okay, so you think we’re wasting time there, right? Okay so I hate it too but not for that reason. Okay. I hate it too but not for that reason. Here’s why-you wanna say why you hate it? Exactly! That’s exactly right. So the comment was: it seems like it goes away and yet we’re relying on it. But look, the assignment statement relies on something for its right hand side. But the minute control is passed back so that the assignment statement is the next thing, this is gone. So that right hand side gets obliterated effectively, effectively is gone the minute the return statement is made. Which means that the right hand side has nothing on it to use. Right hand side is nothing but certainly invalid. Kay any question about that? So what have we done wrong here? Can you describe what we have done wrong? I’ll give you a hint. I don’t know, i don’t know what that dance move is. Kay so the error here is that we’ve returned a local variable by reference and that’s forbidden. Okay? Because it's invalid - it creates an invalid right hand side in this case. okay. so our error um.. oh no.. ","width":20992}],

You are allowed to declare a sphere and then to declare another sphere to be a copy of that one.","width":1088},{"text":"Okay, so maybe in here you would change a somehow.

This may or may not call the copy constructor.","width":704},{"text":"And the reason for it is simply that when you're returning a value, if you can maintain the data in memory some place, making another copy of it ends up being like an extra copy.","width":1024},{"text":"So you're code actually executes faster if it doesn't have to make extra copies all over the place and so where it can it will avoid invoking the copy constructor.","width":768},{"text":"Alright, any question about it?

Sometimes, we want to use the copy constructor to count how many times a copy has been made, say.","width":1728},{"text":"So in that case, and we might want to store that with the object.

  [{"text":"And it is responsible for clearing up the dynamic array. The rest of it is taken care of. Alright, so I at least, found this a little bit confusing at first, because all of this is the result of a delete statement on a sphere pointer, right? But that delete statement invokes a function that also uses a delete statement. So there are kind of two levels of abstraction going on here. Alright, here's the secret, here's the secret, it's probably the case, so each of these things is a string. How do you think a string is implemented? What do you think the string class looks like? It's a type it has a class, it's just standard. Yeah? Yes, a character array, that's right. Is it a static array or dynamic array? Is it on the stack or the heap? It's a heap, it's a dynamic array. So inside this string class is a dynamic array, or we don't really know, it's encapsulated away from us, but we have every reason to believe it is a dynamic array. So how come I don't have to worry about that dynamic memory? Well I write this, why don't I have to say, \"Oh wait I have to clean out my strings?\" Why? Who's they? So the people who implemented string, that's right. Exactly. So strings clean up after themselves. And look what we have done, we have written it so that spheres clean up after themselves. Right? Now, if you have a class that wants to make a dynamic array of spheres, they never need to worry about it, because when spheres go out of scope, they're just gone. When you call delete on a sphere, it's all gone. No big deal. Okay? So there's multiple layers here of things that work. Alright any other questions about this? Alright, fine. Here are some sort of summery information about destructors. We don't call the destructor, we provide it for the system to use in two situations, when a variable goes out of scope, and when delete is called on a pointer to an object of type \"x\".","width":12544},{"text":"And so it's when a variable of type \"x\" goes out of scope. And it's x's destructor is never called. ","width":1152},{"text":"Okay any question about that? So, it's referring to a class, some class. Alright so now, how do we know if we need a destructor? And the answer is, if your constructor allocates dynamic memory, or if any other member function allocates dynamic memory associated with the object. So it's not just the constructor, but if any, if your object has dynamic memory associated with it, you need a destructor. ","width":1984}],
  [{"text":"And allocates dynamic memory. Heap memory is equivalent there. Okay any question?","width":613},{"text":"And then as we saw, a destructor typically consists of the sequence of delete statements, which means, and the way you handle that is basically to go through your private members and go \"Hey! Do I need to delete that?\" No. The answer is no. \"Do I need to delete that?\" No. \"Do I need to delete that?\" Yes.","width":1361},{"text":"So you go through each of the data members and ask yourself whether or not you have used dynamic memory. It's just a checklist.","width":392},{"text":"Okay, questions? Is it good? Okay.","width":323},{"text":"One more problem. Let's trace a little bit of code. I'm going to declare a sphere a and sphere b. ","width":647},{"text":"Okay so here's a, and here's b. And I'm gonna give 'a' value. That is, I'm gonna instantiate 'a' to be something.","width":753},{"text":"4.8, 3, and \"black and white\", \"bouncy\", and how would you characterize a soccer ball? Yeah all spheres are round, but okay fine.","width":1418},{"text":"Whatever, not worth the time. Alright, so now the question is \"What happens when we do that statement?\"","width":716},{"text":"What do you think happens when we do that statement?","width":536},{"text":"A member-wise copy. That's right. The assignment operator is by default member-wise. So again we have this groaner of a situation where 4.8 is copied appropriately, 3 is copied appropriately, and the pointer value is copied appropriately.","width":1674},{"text":"Okay so the problem is assignment.","width":384},{"text":"Okay so the problem is, assignment is member-wise by default.","width":516},{"text":"Okay, so how do we fix it? We redefine what assignment means. We solve by redefining what assignment that.","width":1056},{"text":"That symbol. Okay if haven't ever seen operator overloading before, I assert that this is not new to you.","width":744},{"text":"Even if you have not heard the phrase operator overloading, I assert that you will not be surprised by it because here is what I think.","width":900},{"text":"I think that if I write code that looks like this. If I say int a, b, c, like this and then I initialize a and b so a equals 37, b equals 63.","width":1402},{"text":"If I say that then that code at the bottom is fine, right?","width":532},{"text":"Yes?","width":133},{"text":"Good.","width":219},{"text":"And moreover, I think you will take an alternative. I think if I say double a equals 37 point something, double b equals 63 point something, you're okay with that too. Right?","width":1417},{"text":"So now, you know that what goes on behind the scenes when that operator is invoked is different in each of these cases. Right? It's a little bit different because doubles are implemented differently than integers, so this plus has to behave differently.","width":1337},{"text":"And it didn't freak you out at all. Right? You're like \"Why is she even talking about this?\"","width":326},{"text":"Well here's another thing that I think won't freak you out.

Alright, let's see, so just to remind you this is the code that we were trying to implement and it is this assignment operator that we want to fix.","width":960},{"text":"The way you declare, the way you declare the function that we're going to overwrite is to say sphere.","width":640},{"text":"It turns out that in this context it's okay to return it by reference but we won't here because that will freak you out, freak me out, freak us all out, so we won't.","width":832},{"text":"And now the question is, what does the parameter list have to look like?

Yeah?","width":832},{"text":"Very good, very good, so in the end we're going to want b to look just like this, right? Which means that I better get rid of this one.","width":918},{"text":"Alright, so let's clear up b, we're going to clear up b and then things can feel a lot like the copy constructor.","width":960},{"text":"Okay, we, you know, copy a's value over, copy a's number of attributes over, okay now I need an array that is that long.","width":896},{"text":"And then copy these values over, okay.

One was the ball class.","width":256},{"text":"Do you remember the way that we described the sphere class in the context of inheritance in C++?","width":448},{"text":"Base class, that's right.

So it's a sphere with more information.","width":896},{"text":"And furthermore, observe that the functions that are associated with the ball are concerned primarily with that added information.","width":832},{"text":"So from a design perspective, it's reasonable to think about, \"Okay, what's the functionality of the ball as it relates to the data??","width":576},{"text":"That is, what functions do I need in order to make that data accessible, usable, et cetera?","width":448},{"text":"And leave to the sphere class all the functionality that every sphere might need.","width":512},{"text":"And most of those have to do with its data.

problem","width":192},{"text":"and the answer is","width":128},{"text":"we use keyword virtual","width":128},{"text":"chirp","width":128},{"text":"chirp","width":64},{"text":"silence","width":64},{"text":"wheeee","width":128},{"text":"so the virtual keyword means tha the function may be

actually","width":192},{"text":"there's like 5 more seconds of silence","width":384},{"text":"wheeee","width":192},{"text":"jk there's more","width":128},{"text":"chirp chirp chirp","width":128},{"text":"ok","width":64},{"text":"alright!","width":128},{"text":"and so","width":64},{"text":"now","width":64},{"text":"and so now","width":128},{"text":"this code","width":128},{"text":"will work just fine","width":128},{"text":"k?","width":192},{"text":"i put things in a conditional","width":128},{"text":"and the rigt kind of display will happen","width":256},{"text":"based on which of these assignments occurs","width":256},{"text":"k?","width":64},{"text":"so now you can imagine instead of a=0","width":192},{"text":"who knows what a is","width":64},{"text":"here","width":64},{"text":"you can imagine any conditional here like if","width":256},{"text":"the left button is pushed or the right button is pushed","width":320},{"text":"or if the temprature is over 75 degrees","width":256},{"text":"this can be any conditional","width":128},{"text":"and we can still attach at run time any kind of thing

will always be virtual","width":320},{"text":"k?","width":64},{"text":"so","width":64},{"text":"it's superfluous","width":128},{"text":"for me to say that","width":128},{"text":"but because code is

Yeah so we're well represented here. So Jessica and Victoria want to talk to you about opportunities for, um well, to tell you about reflections projections and how you might participate. Hi I'm in Victoria I'm the chair for reflections projections this year. We have a lot of cool speakers coming in this year between the first and the fourth of October. We also have a programming competition so if want to come build an AI we have awesome prizes, including an Oculus Rift in those. So if you want to come compete and try to win that we'd love to have you. It's October 1 through 4. The programming competition is between the second and third. We have a puzzle competition going on over the course of the event. We also have speakers all of Saturday and some scattered throughout the rest of the event. Two job fairs, one is on Thursday, one is the big job fair on Friday. So if you want to come meet recruiters, see speakers, and maybe compete in a programming competition, come to RP. And here's Jessica to tell you how you can get involved and volunteer. So yeah in addition to experience the event itself, we would love it if some of you or all of you would come help us our during the event. So there is a sign up URL for that, it's www-s.acm.illinois.edu/rpvolunteer. Essentially it's the ACM URL slash rpvolunteer, no special cases, no spaces, just rpvolunteer. If you go there and sign up we will get you fitted for a time slot. And if you volunteer you will be fed, you get food. And you get a free t shirt! Who doesn't love free t shirts. Also food is free for the entire weekend. And it's always good food. OK thanks guys, are you coming back for the next hour? OK nice to see you both. Let's work!

A base class pointer on the left and a derived class pointer on the right. You didn't know where I was going with that, but we did talk about the fact that that was ok. So this assignment is ok because the thing that we're making is a flower. We're building a flower at this point. Right here, I'm sorry, this is wrong. This is wrong, that's why. I almost broke your brains. I am so glad you asked that question! What could I have said that would have not been confusing here? Daisy, very good. Oh my gosh. the whole point of the whole slide was the word that I wrote here, and I screwed it up. Great. Come back next hour, that mistake will not be made, or maybe it should be! maybe I should do that on purpose. Just to see if people are as awake as you. Alright. So, everything I just said is true still, it's still ok to declare a flower pointer, cuz there is no flower constructed there. It would not be ok to say new flow, because we can't build a flower, but we CAN build a daisy. Alright, any questions about this? You should have a question I think. There's no slicing, so we make a daisy, right? Right, so the thing is though, the problem is that once we do this daisy, we don't have access to the daisy specific functionality, but you do have access to any polymorphic function, so when you prescribe what functionality it should have, they're all going to have it anyways because it's virtual, so we can reach it through the flower pointer. Because the functions are declared in the flower. Let's talk about it later, and i encourage you to go experiment. So here's the thing about inheritance, you see it about twice in this class, well maybe three times. We're doing it mostly because you're going to see it in your life, not because you'll see it a lot in data structures in this concert. We're trying to increase your curiosity about it, a little bit of functionality, but not a while lot. I have a question for you, what if i had done this? No, the presence of that = 0 does the same thing. If there's one of the =0, then it is an abstract class. Can I add an equal 0? can I do that? Yes, I can, but the I have no daisy. What this says is that I derive from the daisy class, well is it a Gerber daisy or a freeway daisy?This demands that we be specific about the kind of stem that we draw, apparently. Any questions about it? There may be some sort of reduncy there, in fact I don't think the compiler will let you say =0 without putting virtual  f","width":17258}],

How can I fix that. Pass by reference. very good. Don't say pointer to me. Alright good. so lets talk about the first point in a little bit more detail. so this is fine right to have these two functions that do pretty much the same thing. in fact if someone were asking you to include these two functions in an mp, you'd go. oh yay.

A drawback of doing it this way is that you would have to go and find all of these little swap functions and change them right to take advantage of this new new fangled swap algorithm. ok. yes its artificial. alright so code reuse is important for maintainence and incremental improvement of code. ok. and we admit here that look . they are about the same. so how on earth are we going to unfiy those two functions into one thing but still allow for type information to be recorderd in the code. and the answer is that C++ provides syntax for passing as a parameter type information. type information into the function. ok. alright so how does this work. I have my same main except that i am writing a single swap function. the way we tell the system exactly how we want swap to work is we have this alternative syntax for parameterizing type and we put in between angle brackets. so first you have the type parameters and then you have the value parameters. similarly here we would do char and I'll tell you right now that if you forget to do this when the compiler can. it will infer it for you so sometimes its not the case that you'll see those angle brackets even for templated class ok so if the system can infer it. it will. ok. so now that's how you use these template functions. how do you define them. well you prepend the function's signature above the first line. it becomes the first line. um with this key word template this is a key word. class which is also a key word but it could be type name instead.","width":17152}],

Yeah?","width":320},{"text":"Um, so I think the compiler, so","width":256},{"text":"if you just said ezpair here the compiler would infer","width":320},{"text":"what you mean so you wouldn't have had to do this","width":229},{"text":"but I actually - when I read code it helps me a lot","width":292},{"text":"to have that there.","width":88},{"text":"So yes, it's optional for functionality,","width":164},{"text":"but it's, erm it's important for maintainability.","width":232},{"text":"K?","width":64},{"text":"Alright, so lets see... So let's talk about","width":320},{"text":"getmax. So if you execute this code what do you get?","width":192},{"text":"You execute this code what do you get?","width":192},{"text":"Take a look at what getmax - oh, getmax is funky","width":384},{"text":"What would you expect if you couldn't see that code up there what would you get?","width":312},{"text":"A hundred that's right. Now lets go look","width":192},{"text":"Now let's go look at the code.","width":115},{"text":"Alright. So getmax is implemented","width":165},{"text":"to return an integer, right or","width":192},{"text":"to return whatever the parameterized type is","width":204},{"text":"and, er, it sets up a value for return","width":252},{"text":"What is this?","width":64}],
  [{"text":"Yeah we refer to it as a yes you wanna tell me instead of me telling you? Say it loud.","width":400},{"text":"It's an if statement, that's right. That saved me three lines of code right there which is important here.","width":510},{"text":"Oh I don't what I intended for this but it feels like it was important.","width":312},{"text":"Actually the reason I did this is because I want you to see it, right. I want you to know that it exists.","width":401},{"text":"This is called a ternary operator and it effectively in very very simple cases replaces a conditional.","width":562},{"text":"So this is a shorthand conditional.","width":608},{"text":"Okay so it says if this then return a, otherwise return b and then assign that by return value across the equal sign to retmax and then return retmax.","width":934},{"text":"Okay there's something that should bug you about this code.","width":449},{"text":"It's very very subtle.","width":365},{"text":"And the way to think of it is think of all the things that come in pairs.","width":405},{"text":"When I say name something that comes in pairs, what's the first thing you think of?","width":384},{"text":"Shoes, okay, okay fine.","width":219},{"text":"It feels like then that we should be able to instantiate ezpair with shoes right? The shoe class.","width":591},{"text":"Right? What would happen for getmax if we did that?","width":375},{"text":"Yeah?","width":385},{"text":"That's right, very good, so did you here him?","width":174},{"text":"He said he made note of the point, I don't know what greater than means for shoes.","width":465},{"text":"I know what it means for integers. I can guess what it means for characters. I have no idea what it means for shoes.","width":413},{"text":"Um and so the implication of that is in order for that code to work on the shoe class, we would have to have overloaded the greater than operator.","width":902},{"text":"So the greater than operator must be implemented in any class using, wait, any class passed to is the right way to say it, ezpair.","width":1624},{"text":"Okay? Alright so it feels like a restriction but it's okay and the really good news about it is when the mistake is caught.","width":784},{"text":"Okay so if we tried to use ur ezpair on the shoes, who would tell us NO NO NO you can't do that? Who would do it?","width":744},{"text":"The compiler, that's right. The compiler would say I know you want to use ezpair on shoes but you can't.","width":397},{"text":"You need to define a greater than operator in order to do so.","width":256},{"text":"Okay? Any questions about that at all?","width":179},{"text":"So is a compiler demands that er this exist.","width":768},{"text":"So the compiler has to be able to look at all of the code, all of the code and determine exactly what functionality it means. Yes?","width":822},{"text":"twoNums, it's an variable, this is a variable.","width":334},{"text":"It could be frog, it could be Alex, it could be...

We want to exploit the fact that this chain of memory all linked together is a listNode pointer instantiated with the listNode together with another chain that looks just the same, that is just a smaller instance of the original problem. This situation begs for recursion, that's right.

  [{"text":"of a data structure. And data structure is a little bit loosely used here, but its okay, You'll let me get away with it.","width":768},{"text":"Alright, so the first abstract data type that we are going to talk about is, dun dun dun, a list.","width":384},{"text":"Now, this is an abstract notion of a list. This is a list like your to do list for today which includes playing Frisbee outside.","width":768},{"text":"And doing your homework and studying for your exam and working and uh, I'm sorry for the stress of your lives.","width":668},{"text":"Alright, so this abstract notion of a list includes your list of things to do today, it includes your list of favorite movies, it includes, I don't know, your contact list, it includes any list that you might want to keep track of data in some ordered fashion.","width":1482},{"text":"Any question about that? Grocery list, the list of classes you go to, any collection of things where you care about their positions.","width":768},{"text":"Now, heres the cool thing about the abstract data type for the list class, and in fact for any abstract data type that we will study. C++ puts the abstract data type into the class definition, the public section of the class definition.","width":1280},{"text":"So, the cool thing is, if I asked you about the functionality of your general notion of a list, you could point to the header file, point to the class definition contained in the header file and say look, I can create you a list, that's part of its functionality, I can tell you the size of the list, you can insert new things into it in a particular spot, you can remove things from a particular spot, and you can return the data contained in a particular spot.","width":2496},{"text":"And that right there, this is the ADT for a general list. Operative word there is list. And the only reason i say general there is to distinguish it from what we thing of as a linked list.","width":1216},{"text":"This is not necessarily a linked list. Okay, notice that we can use this list, this abstract data type list, by simply looking at the public section for it, and I get to keep this secret. I don't have to tell you what data is associated with the list, i just have to promise you that i will fulfill that functionality.","width":1984},{"text":"that I will implement that abstract data type. Okay? Alright, so fine, lets get a feel for what these lists are by walking through a little bit of client code, designed to illustrate the fact that we can be functional without having to know about the implementation.","width":1280},{"text":"So the first thing we do is we initialize the thing, it is a list containing integers, that's good. And now I'm just going to use it. I'm going to insert into the first position number 4. Here is my list.","width":1280},{"text":"I'm just going to put it right here. I'm just going to put my list right here, the front of the list is on this side.","width":503},{"text":"And now I'm going to insert into the first position number 6 and now where is 4? The second position, right? You are moving things down. It's sort of like you have a list of favorite movies and you see a better movie, its not like your previous best movie disappears, rather it moves to your second best movie. And that's just how a list class is supposed to function.","width":1984},{"text":"And now I'm going to insert 8 into the front of the list. Okay. Then I am going to insert into the third position, value 0.","width":903},{"text":"Okay, so I think i put it right here. Yes? And then I will insert into the fourth position, the get item number 2, so in the end it should look something like this. And it should be sort of opaque to you what actually happened in memory when scratching out and moving around happened. That's all encapsulated away.","width":2321},{"text":"Alright, and then I want to Cout the size, we better get 5 here. I want to remove the second thing. And then i want to get the third thing, so this should give us 6. Okay?","width":1143},{"text":"So this list is really an ordered collection of items. Ordered...","width":821}],
  [{"text":"... collection of items, okay.","width":334},{"text":"Alright, any questions about it? Yeah? Raise, your hand, if you had that question.

Okay.","width":1632},{"text":"","width":1},{"text":"I need to whisper to you, okay, because this is a secret. We are the only people in the world that worry about this.","width":1143},{"text":"Alright. Okay. So thank you for asking the question.","width":839},{"text":"I was hoping someone would.","width":128},{"text":"Ummm, yeah, so you know we're custom to indexing things by zero, right?","width":448},{"text":"But, when you are talking about a list, you know, if I ask you to write down your top five movies... If i ask your top... okay, we'll do three.","width":832},{"text":"Write down your top three movies. You can initial them, I don't care what they are, okay.","width":290},{"text":"Write down your top three movies, real quick, just so you can remind yourself \"one two and three.\" And I say, put your finger on your favorite movie, there is no ambiguity there, right?","width":592},{"text":"Like, favorite means first best. Put your favorite... put your finger on the first one you'd see if you had a chance.","width":434},{"text":"Like, there really is no ambiguity on the understanding of the first thing in a list, in the rest of the world.","width":548},{"text":"And that's what we're implementing here.","width":166},{"text":"So, raise your hand if the Princess Bride is among your top three movies?","width":256},{"text":"Okay, if you... and raise your hand if you have not seen the Princess Bride.","width":448},{"text":"Okay, so if you want to change your list, go watch the Princess Bride.","width":384},{"text":"Alright, so the point is, ummmm, whats the point? The point is that you always want to think about what the client expects.","width":888},{"text":"The world expects lists to have a first element, and that first element is not something you say \"a first element,\" right?","width":768},{"text":"You say a first element. It means one.","width":256},{"text":"And because thats what the user of your class expects, that's how you implement it.","width":517},{"text":"The interface has to behave in a way that is not unfamiliar to the people using it, okay?","width":512},{"text":"That's a little software design... a little piece of software design for you.","width":320},{"text":"Alright, any questions about that? And yes, I know, we start from zero, and there's lots of economies to be gained.","width":448},{"text":"When we right code for each other, we can start at zero, that's fine, okay?","width":384},{"text":"But when we write it for general use, we should be very sensitive about who's reading the code.","width":384},{"text":"Did you have a comment or question? You're good? Were you going to point out that we're really writing code for each other? Yeah?","width":512},{"text":"How does a destructor work for a list? Well it depends on how the list is implemented, and that's actually the next thing I want to talk about.","width":576},{"text":"So notice here that I didn't tell you how we made this happen. The implementation of an abstract data type is not necessary to be known.","width":1024},{"text":"We encapsulated it away.","width":110},{"text":"It's a separate conversation. Now it's absolutely true that we are going to be talking implementations a lot, and in great deal, but to talk about the abstract data type ermm generally, discussion of implementation is not part of the discussion.","width":1280},{"text":"Okay, ummm, let's see, but you are asking about what's my little secret, and I'll show it to you.","width":518},{"text":"Now, look at the class here. Look what I did.","width":384},{"text":"I made a list, I created a way of us implemented a list, yes?","width":303},{"text":"Yes, do you like it?","width":320}],
  [{"text":"Tell me what that implementation is? Is you have to describe that implementation, what would you say? ","width":384},{"text":"It's an array, good. I even drew a little picture for you.

That one even won't hold your to-do list.","width":512},{"text":"Probably. It would hold my grocery list but it would not hold your to-do list. It's too small.

The number of valid things in the list.

","width":192},{"text":"And that's the implementation. Any questions about it? ","width":320},{"text":"So notice what I'm neglecting here. I'm neglecting kind of what to do about the fact that some lists are longer. ","width":768},{"text":"We are gonna handle that in a couple different ways over the course of the next week or so. ","width":320},{"text":"But we that said, I want to talk about a little bit of a technical detail even if we used an array to implement an ordered collection of things.

  [{"text":"...to two four, yea. So in the end it looks like four, three, eleven, five, nine. And then there's room for my heart. Okay. What do you think about this? Say it stinks. Thank you. Why does it stink? Oh my gosh. All we're doing is inserting into this puppy, and you have to open up a space?! That shifting is incredibly expensive. So this incurs an order n because it's a loop...potentially all of your data to shift. Okay. And so, this is bad. This is not a heart. It's rather a sad face. I guess you can do it like this. Oops. Yea you can do it like this. Why is that funny? If that's all it takes man, woooo haha okay. Here. There. All right. Any question about that? How else can we use a list for, um, I'm sorry, an array to implement a list? Well, you can put the front of the list out here, right? ","width":6464},{"text":"But you can kinda... But you incur the same problem so if I say insert one three. Put it here. And then one four. Then I can put four here and here's the front of the list, right? That makes sense? So here's the first item of the list. Here's the second item of the list. And then if I say one five. I can put five here and move the front of the list to there. Do you like that? Yea? How would I keep track where the front of the list is? Right? I can put it there. I can put an index there. Fine. Um, but then I'm going to say, eh, I-I'mma add a bunch of things to it: nine, eleven, twelve. And now I'm going to say insert into position, uh, I don't know. Where do you want to put it? How about six, value, um, frowny face. Okay? Where's frowny face supposed to go? Right between these guys, right? So it means I got to scoot all of these over. Okay, so there's a shift. So this one's here, this one's here, nine, five, four, and then the frowny face goes here. Okay? And again, that's big O of n. Okay. So we can't keep the front at the start of the list. We can't keep the back at, I'm sorry, at the start of the array. We can't keep the back at the start of the array. There's no good place to keep at the start of the array and honestly, you know what? We can always do insertions right, like, between sort of halfway in the middle. Right? Because those openings must occur or can occur anywhere in the list, and we can't predict it, we will always have this shifting problem. So we can't avoid the shifting problem if we allow insert into the middle of the list, so given the list interface we defined or the list ADT. Okay? All right!

Do you see what I aww...","width":421},{"text":"No problem.","width":1568},{"text":"Okay I totally screwed up. Do you see what I screwed up?

Fine.","width":128},{"text":"So there is one thing I wanna say about the interface.","width":246},{"text":"I made a simplifying statement and that is, you don't have to worry about popping an empty stack.","width":320},{"text":"If effectively, I mean, in fact, you probably should write code that is a little bit defensive to that.","width":448},{"text":"You should have an exception handled here.","width":192},{"text":"But we are not in a business of doing that.","width":128},{"text":"And moreover, in this class, and moreover, the fact that we gave the client the capability of checking to see whether there's an empty stack.","width":788},{"text":"The fact that we created this empty function means we can say, \"Ho, dude, that your responsibility.\"","width":493},{"text":"You have to check, to the client, you have to check, whether or not this is empty.","width":256},{"text":"I made no promises if you tried to pop an empty stack, Ok?","width":336},{"text":"So, providing a functionality to the client for checking for empty is kind of our way of saying that it's the client's responsibility to do so.","width":687},{"text":"OK","width":75},{"text":"And this is it.","width":64},{"text":"This is about the simplest guess in terms of the implementation.","width":256},{"text":"And I thought you would ask, \"don't we want to use a sentinel node?\"","width":512},{"text":"And the answer is \"no, we don't need a sentinel node here because all of our insertions and deletions are happening in that first spot.\"","width":768},{"text":"Right? We don't need to worry about the general case.","width":192},{"text":"In this case.","width":64},{"text":"So sentinel node is just sort of a waste of time here.","width":207},{"text":"Makes for more complex code.","width":177},{"text":"OK. So let's take about the array-base implement for a minute.","width":362},{"text":"OK. So the interface is the same. We are going to be implementing push and pop and, you know, empty just returns a boolean value referencing sending whether or not the size is zero. So that's easy.","width":1408},{"text":"Here is the constructor","width":516},{"text":"I don't know which order I may wanna talk about this. OK","width":338},{"text":"So in this case, I've gotten an item's poin... I have items which is an SIT pointer.","width":397},{"text":"And because we are implementing this as an array, you recognize this is just a dynamic array.","width":380},{"text":"Right? This is just a dynamic array.","width":143},{"text":"Now size here, is intended to be the number of elements in the stack.","width":448},{"text":"Capacity is the number that our stack can hold.","width":295},{"text":"So this is... Capacity is capacity. Size is size. Right?","width":384},{"text":"Capacity is, the number we can hold.","width":448},{"text":"And size is the number we are currently holding, or the number we do hold.","width":476},{"text":"OK. Any question about that?","width":256},{"text":"Yeah?","width":128},{"text":"Ah, do we wanna make capacity constant.","width":283},{"text":"So this is the moment. This is the moment where, we actually begin to discuss what it means to have a dynamic array.","width":640},{"text":"Because if we did not allow, for the the array to have variable size, then that would present a huge drawback over using a linked list, right?","width":896},{"text":"And so now it is the time we are actually going to first exploit the fact that it is a dynamic array.","width":614},{"text":"OK? Any question about that? So it is exactly the right comment.","width":237},{"text":"Alright. So this is going to be a dynamic array. Capacity is deliberately not going to be something fixed. We are going to allow it to vary.","width":557},{"text":"Alright. So what does the constructor do?","width":192},{"text":"It makes... It starts off with an array of size four.","width":256},{"text":"Arbitraryly chosen. Could 've been one. Probably couldn't be zero though. That would not be accepted probably?","width":463},{"text":"And then it allocates the memory.","width":192},{"text":"So now, effectively, after this thing is constructed, we are dealing with an array of size four.","width":512},{"text":"Any time we push onto it, we're going to check to see whether or not the size is greater than or equal to the capacity.","width":704},{"text":"That is, is the array full?","width":192},{"text":"Is the array......full?","width":256},{"text":"And if it is, we are going to grow the array somehow.","width":448},{"text":"Oh, that's new. That's what we are gonna talk about the whole rest of the day.","width":512},{"text":"OK, we are going to grow the array somehow.","width":128},{"text":"And then, we are going to enter in the element that we want and increment the size.","width":384},{"text":"What does the code look like?","width":320},{"text":"for pop?","width":114},{"text":"What does the code look like for pop?","width":128}],

Arrays win every single time. If you can think of a clever way of implementing something using an array, do it. Okay? All right! Uh, but the analysis here is array-based implementation of a stack is a constant time pop, is a constant time push if there's capacity. Uh, the cost over n pushes is big O of n for an average of big O of one per push. When you take the, um, algorithms course, uh, CS 374, instead of calling this average, they're going to call it amortized analysis. Um, it's just an issue of, they have a different use of the word 'average'. They're taking an average over a different probability space. It's okay for us to call this average in this context.

Nathan? Yeah? right. So how do you know you're overloading dereference, or multiplication and the answer is in the number of arguments, so when you dereference, so remember that a function is in part declared by its parameters, i can have two functions of the same name but if they are parameterized differently, then they are different functions, and the same thing is true for dereference operators. it has one and in fact in this case, effectively there are no arguments, it is just the thing. K. and instead of the binary operator. Yeah? could i accomplish this same thing with primitive types? not nearly so elegantly right? So i could do this if i implemented my own list class with a dynamic array and made it but so i could do this in C is sort of what you're asking me basically right? but i wouldn't want to. i wouldn't want to, this is one of the elegances,  elegancies from having C++ ok? Alright any other questions about this right now? ok alright. so uhh, my question is for you, is what is printed out? this is cout, this is the contents of our list, what is printed out? k so the names so we get giraffe, and leaves, and then the next time through we get penguin, and fish and then... do you?

Sure, it's a root together with left and right subtrees. The left subtree has some substance and the right subtree is...is empty. So we're OK. Alright, any questions about that recursive definition? OK, well...Uh...Let's see. So we're going to write functions on these structures and these functions can come in lots of different forms and in fact the data contained in this...The data contained in this particular example tells you about one of the functions you can write on binary trees. What does that data look like? What does that data remind you of? Can you imagine? Computation, right. Evaluation of an expression, that's right. So, in fact, you can imagine that every subtree is like a parenthesized phrase, right. So this triangle has parenthesis around it, this one has parenthesis around it. The whole thing has parenthesis. So this is an example of an expression tree and if we know how to get around on this structure, using say...Traversal. Then we may have a good way of evaluating such a structure. But we're not doing that right now. Okay. Alright, so let's write some functions on this structure. The first one we're going to write is height. Now, you guys talked about height last time, right? What's wrong? We didn't...Mattox and I didn't get a chance to talk beforehand and so the definition that he used is a different one then we're going to use. Okay? So, the definition of height that we're going to use in our class is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. Okay? So what does that mean about the height of that tree? What's the height of that tree? Height here is 3, good. 1, 2, 3. Okay? Path length is number of steps or number of edges. Okay, that's all good and fine. Uh, what is the height of here's this example. What is the height of this tree? What's the height of that tree? Zero, very good. And what's the height of five's left subtree? This is where there's a problem. We should all be going gulp I don't know. gulp I don't know. Alright, let's talk about it a minute. Alright, so given a height, given a tree T a recursive definition of the height of T. Alright, so this is what I think is true. The height of T is one plus the maximum height. This is what you did last time. H E I G H T of TL and height of TR. Right? Nothing's different than last time. The problem is...The problem is what's the height of an empty tree? So if I draw you a picture of an empty tree, what's it's height? I drew you a picture of an empty tree, see it? It's lovely isn't it, it is both the most beautiful and the ugliest tree you've ever seen. Right? It's an empty tree. So what's the height of the longest path from the root to a leaf? Uh...uhh...What path? What path? OK. So there is no root, there is no leaf, there is no path. It's completely indetermenant. So we can choose any height we want. Now. Because we can have empty trees it makes sense to choose a height for that empty-ness, the absence, to be something that makes sense. Okay? Does something that helps us out mathematically. Well, you were already whispering what helps us out mathematically. It is the solution that gives us a zero for a single node tree. And it is, what is it? Negative one, that's right. So the height of an empty tree is negative one. tree? What's the height of that tree? Height here is 3, good. 1, 2, 3. Okay? Path length is number of steps or number of edges. Okay, that's all good and fine. Uh, what is the height of her","width":11712}],

  [{"text":"An abstract data type called a...there's a hint on the screen...dictionary. The Abstract data type","width":576},{"text":"that we were interested in was called a dictionary.

","width":448},{"text":"Binary search trees that's right. Here's an example of one and I think a quick glance will remind you of that thing, okay?","width":704},{"text":"Now, inside this class dictionary, which is templated to accept a key type and a data type. ","width":576},{"text":"I have sort of spelled out the necessary components that we needed to implement the dictionary using the binary search tree. ","width":640},{"text":"But, oh and going along with that, I asked you to just please accept that the contents of each node were keys, and that the data is hiding somewhere behind the node. ","width":1088},{"text":"Then our focus became manipulating the structure based on their keys, okay?","width":384},{"text":"And we got most of the way through this little list of functionality here. ","width":512},{"text":"We did traversal a few days ago, we did inserting and finding in the structure. ","width":384},{"text":"And today we are gonna focus on remove it. Now at this moment I'm gonna stop talking about dictionaries per se. ","width":640},{"text":"And focus on the implementation. The rest of the code you are gonna see today, instead of being class dictionary, ","width":576},{"text":"is going to be class BST. And I'm not gonna focus on the data.

a binary search tree.","width":412},{"text":"I could mean something we have refer to as the rank of a binary search tree which is [gibberish] like the largest imbalanced perfect tree, the rank, the height of the large imbalanced perfect tree.","width":969},{"text":"Just another [gibberish], you don't...","width":118},{"text":"that will not be on the test, probably.","width":261},{"text":"No!","width":70},{"text":"Em...","width":50},{"text":"but the one that we are focusing on for now is balancing the height.","width":427},{"text":"So making sure that a search algorithm, em...","width":263},{"text":"traverse subtrees that are approximately equivalent height.","width":288},{"text":"Okay, so we defined this measurement on a tree, em...","width":305},{"text":"which is just a difference in the height of the subtrees, no mystery there.","width":310},{"text":"Em...","width":27},{"text":"I'm not really, I never remember whether this is L minus R or R minus L, it's sort of a matter of low level detail, but you can kinda debug when you need to.","width":831},{"text":"But, em...","width":80},{"text":"so If you ask me I'll probably look at you empty, with empty eyes.","width":348},{"text":"It's the different matters, the absolute values are different.","width":240},{"text":"Okay, so this is a measurement on a

want to write a recursive function to do this right?","width":593},{"text":"So write a recursive function that checks to see if these are out of balance, so the code that can check for balance is

should we implement is using pointer or as an array.\" and we decided it should be clever use of an array.","width":635},{"text":"and this notion that an abstract data type can actually lead to this sort of unfolding discussion of implementation in incre...","width":674},{"text":"decreasing abstraction more specificity is fascination to me.","width":326},{"text":"more over, there are tons of structures and algorithms for which priority queues are an extremely important, um, element.","width":679},{"text":"so for example the event queue in every single video game that ever exists.","width":352},{"text":"so this an event queue.","width":135},{"text":"uses a priority queue.","width":93},{"text":"it which one need to come next.","width":134},{"text":"it's the.","width":70},{"text":"it is prioritized by time.","width":181},{"text":"even if all the events were created at the same time it can be thrown into a priority queue so that the next one with

level.","width":105},{"text":"but that, i bet they did.","width":65},{"text":"so memory allocation...","width":165},{"text":"where in this instance.","width":294},{"text":"the size of the block of

know.","width":208},{"text":"Um.","width":33},{"text":"Uh, alright.","width":123},{"text":"So, you know, this is this function that determines the keys, the ordering in the priority queue can be lots

mergesort.","width":105},{"text":"Perfectly fine, perfectly reasonable idea.","width":289},{"text":"But we can do better.","width":115},{"text":"What is it mean to do better?","width":198},{"text":"What's the running time for mergesort?","width":244},{"text":"Big o of woah.","width":298},{"text":"Okay, you guys gotta write this down and put it on your mirror, okay?","width":239},{"text":"This can even if you don't know the proof of this, it should just roll right off.","width":278},{"text":"You can, you can be talking about stuff you don't know, but this one should just roll off.","width":236},{"text":"The running time of merge watch me get it wrong here the running time of mergesort worst case is nlog(n).","width":568},{"text":"So you're guaranteed nlog(n) for mergesort.","width":211},{"text":"It's not a great sort because it's very hard to do in place, especially if you're doing it in an array.","width":378},{"text":"But you actually did it in place in for mp3, I think, but your memory was all over the place.","width":403},{"text":"Alright, uh let's see.","width":168},{"text":"So, okay, so we could sort it, that would work.","width":271},{"text":"What else could we do?","width":130},{"text":"Yeah?","width":6},{"text":"Oh use heapify.","width":281},{"text":"How would you use heapify?","width":190},{"text":"What would you do?","width":213},{"text":"What is, what what how would you use heapify here?","width":401},{"text":"How would you use heapify?","width":83},{"text":"Oh, heapify down through the it turns out that doesn't work.","width":394},{"text":"Okay?","width":86},{"text":"Yeah?","width":224},{"text":"Very good, very good.","width":80},{"text":"So the other thing you can do is pretend like, pretend like this is just data that happens to be sitting in memory and do repeated insertion into the structure.","width":827},{"text":"So first we've got, an empty heap.","width":172},{"text":"And we're going to add B to it.","width":246},{"text":"Okay?","width":42},{"text":"Well, there.","width":77},{"text":"We did heapify up from here.","width":131},{"text":"Fine.","width":24},{"text":"Done.","width":51},{"text":"Then we're going to add U to it.","width":112},{"text":"And now we can look at this part and say okay that's a good heap.","width":296},{"text":"Then we can add I to it.","width":157},{"text":"And that's a heap.","width":98},{"text":"And then we add L to it, and what happens?","width":296},{"text":"No it's fine, this is fine.","width":115},{"text":"You have to swap, right, but you're inserting.","width":218},{"text":"So you get heapify up for free.","width":200},{"text":"So L and U should swap.","width":300},{"text":"Okay.","width":78},{"text":"And now that's a heap.","width":197},{"text":"And now everything up to here is a heap.","width":122},{"text":"Okay, so do you see how this

good!","width":166},{"text":"No two of the same shape are connected.","width":304},{"text":"We say that, the vertices on this graph are colored.","width":362},{"text":"In this case they are colored and shaped.","width":201},{"text":"And what that means is, every edge's endpoints are different.","width":398},{"text":"Now, what on Earth is this graph used for?","width":181},{"text":"It's very timely, because it's used for finals scheduling.","width":415},{"text":"So, all of the, for example, I'm going to take the green circles because they're easy to talk about and easy to

break.","width":311},{"text":"Right.","width":64},{"text":"So each car can only go, you're trying to get the red car out, and each car can only move forward and backward it's a little puzzle.","width":467},{"text":"Alright, so the question is what's the graph?","width":119},{"text":"Now remember, remember, that to describe a graph, means to tell what the vertices represent and what the edges represent.","width":612},{"text":"So what the heck is that graph?","width":244},{"text":"You're welcome to come up here closer if you can't see very well from back there.","width":285},{"text":"You're just welcome to stand right up and come and look if you like.","width":189},{"text":"Let me see how well you can see.","width":151},{"text":"Can you see very well?","width":281},{"text":"Kind of, okay.","width":53},{"text":"Where it looks like there might be an edge between them, pretend there is.","width":248},{"text":"What is the graph what are the vertices, and what are the edges?","width":286},{"text":"And then I'm gonna ask what are the green dots?","width":296},{"text":"Mmmmmm.","width":130},{"text":"Finishing positions is a good guess.","width":232},{"text":"It's a good guess.","width":152},{"text":"Yeah?","width":56},{"text":"Start with vertices.","width":411},{"text":"Yes, very good.","width":103},{"text":"So we say that the ver- each vertex is a state of the game, and that corresponds to a position, a set of positions, of all the cars.","width":667},{"text":"So presumably, that picture in the upper right hand corner, corresponds to one of the vertices in the graph.","width":574},{"text":"Okay?","width":13},{"text":"Any question about that?","width":386},{"text":"Yeah?","width":99},{"text":"Yes!","width":124},{"text":"Very good.","width":51},{"text":"So the edges between them are uh correspond to the ability to move from one position to another via a valid move.","width":697},{"text":"Okay?","width":25},{"text":"Alright, fine, What are the green dots?","width":314},{"text":"Yeah?","width":127},{"text":"Yeah!","width":14},{"text":"The path to completion, very good.","width":149},{"text":"So presumably this is the start configuration, and I'm guessing, I'm hoping, I guess, that in fact those green dots correspond to the shortest path to completion, okay?","width":1020},{"text":"And that blue up there is done.","width":225},{"text":"Alright, so what's with all of fan out up there, with all the different the fan out in the path?","width":386},{"text":"Somebody who plays the game, tell me what happens at the very end.","width":946},{"text":"Somebody who's played the game, tell me what happens at the very end.","width":761},{"text":"Yeah?","width":169},{"text":"[student response] Uh huh?","width":140},{"text":"Ah!","width":30},{"text":"Okay, so I think, that that corresponds to ending of over here, but I don't think it describes this stuff.","width":942},{"text":"Yeah?","width":228},{"text":"Yeah okay, so sort of.","width":409},{"text":"That's a little closer.","width":126},{"text":"So those are all the shortest paths so presumably you wouldn't have any kind of \"extra\" moves.","width":370},{"text":"Gratuitous extra moves.","width":130},{"text":"The answer is when you're close to the end, there are lots of different ways to finish it off.","width":301},{"text":"Right, like you can move backward and, you know, I don't know.","width":248},{"text":"You can- you get to decide which one to move first and you know, you can finish the game up either way.","width":558},{"text":"So at the very end, there are lot more degrees of freedom to finishing the game efficiently, k?","width":359},{"text":"So this is a great game to play, while you're riding a bus, say over thanksgiving.","width":391},{"text":"I'm pretty sure there are mobile versions of it.","width":147},{"text":"In fact, all these think-fun puzzle games, are
