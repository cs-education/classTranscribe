could blank it out","width":173},{"text":"we could say star p equals","width":147},{"text":"and it might be tempting to write an astericks here","width":376},{"text":"but that's not right because the asterisk means I've given the address of the asterisk","width":473},{"text":"so I'd be writing an asterisk into the address of the asterisk into that occasion","width":483},{"text":"if I run this I get a few warnings","width":134},{"text":"but it runs and it runs it for forever because my loops runs forever","width":257},{"text":"so let me ctrl-c that to break it","width":171},{"text":"this time change the loop so I add one to p each time","width":504},{"text":"so now I've got a very strange character because it's taken the lowest eight bits and copied that into my character","width":555},{"text":"instead let's change that to the actual bitwise pattern of my character","width":326},{"text":"now I've got something which can get rid of swear words by over writing them with asterisks or perhaps a password or something","width":573},{"text":"but we didn't want to do that for all the characters, we just wanted to do that for the l's","width":208},{"text":"so let's see if my p is, at when I look at that memory location, whether it's a lowercase l","width":594},{"text":"and as I said before because we are working with characters it is ok to compare them so note the use of double equals here","width":553},{"text":"okay so let's run that","width":341},{"text":"we have a couple of errors here","width":204},{"text":"for starters we're not using pointer","width":150},{"text":"so I can comment out that line","width":111},{"text":"I've got another problem here which is that change is implicitly declared","width":289},{"text":"that's because we haven't declared what the function signature of change() looks like","width":301},{"text":"let's do that now","width":89},{"text":"I'm going to say later on compiler, I expect to actually define a function and I'll give you the actual code to create this change method","width":700},{"text":"but for now here is what it's signature looks like","width":153},{"text":"it's called change, it takes a pointer to a character and it doesn't return anything","width":272},{"text":"so if I compile that now my warnings should go away","width":283},{"text":"great so I've got a function that can walk through","width":402},{"text":"I could have another function that finds letters as well","width":186},{"text":"so for example suppose we wanted to find the first o in this","width":503},{"text":"I could change this so that rather than changing the letters","width":413},{"text":"if the contents of p is an 'o', let's return p","width":466},{"text":"now I'm going to change my method signature","width":243},{"text":"and I'd better have a return value that returns something if I get to the very end","width":338},{"text":"so for example, it returns where p is","width":324},{"text":"we can now update my original code so that it finds the first 'o' and gives you back a pointer to that","width":876},{"text":"if I print that out","width":93},{"text":"hopefully you can guess what my program should do","width":407},{"text":"okay so it gave us back a string and it this time the pointer was half way through \"hello world\"","width":453},{"text":"that's OK, our pointers don't care what they point to","width":278},{"text":"we know that strings will continue until we reach the null byte at the end","width":384},{"text":"so that's how we were able to print out hello world","width":257},{"text":"okay that's enough for me, time for you to play. bye!","width":83}],

  [{"text":"hi welcome","width":116},{"text":"so we have got a little function so far called currenttime()","width":136},{"text":"that requests 128 bytes from the heap","width":307},{"text":"and then providing we get a non-null pointer back from malloc","width":263},{"text":"we will copy in the time 2:51 PM into that memory","width":288},{"text":"and then return a pointer to the first byte of that memory so that's our little currenttime","width":262},{"text":"we've been careful to make sure that if malloc fails, perhaps our program has used all of the heap memory","width":411},{"text":"then we don't try to use that null pointer","width":207},{"text":"but now let's actually make it so that it actually makes a call to find out what the current time is","width":540},{"text":"the current time is known by the system","width":114},{"text":"so it's time to make a system call and then we will format that using a c function called ctime()","width":529},{"text":"to actually give us a human readable version of the time","width":328},{"text":"both of these functions can be found inside the include time.h","width":306},{"text":"I've commented them up here","width":113},{"text":"so the first think we can do is call time so when you call time you can pass it a pointer to a time_t variable","width":717},{"text":"or you can say actuall I'm not going to give you anything and it will still give you back the time in its result","width":512},{"text":"so let's just use the result","width":145},{"text":"so here's the number of seconds since 1970","width":534},{"text":"we'll store that inside our little variable called secondsSince1970","width":359},{"text":"but I don't want that as a value, I just want to turn that into a string","width":224},{"text":"for that there's a function called ctime, this a library function. there are other functions that give greater control to the precise formatting","width":630},{"text":"but for this demo let's just use ctime() which has some reasonable formatting that most people can understand","width":617},{"text":"this will give us back a pointer to the time","width":319},{"text":"so the time in ASCII, in otherwords in letters, in readable time","width":484},{"text":"and then we can use that and copy that result into new memory, into our result","width":526},{"text":"so one problem with ctime() is that it uses static storage","width":339},{"text":"in other words it's great if you just want to call it once, and it will use it's static storage to give you back the time in a readable format","width":674},{"text":"but don't expect that to stay around because if you call ctime() again in the future it is going to overwrite those bytes","width":455},{"text":"and that's why our little function here called currenttime() is useful","width":200},{"text":"we are going to take that temporary result and put it into some memory that is ours to control","width":403},{"text":"so it can't be overwritten","width":174},{"text":"we need to pass in seconds since midnight","width":223},{"text":"except we've got a problem here","width":208},{"text":"it doesn't actually want the value, it wants a pointer to this variable, it wants to know where in memory this variable is","width":554},{"text":"for that I have to introduce some new syntax, which is the &","width":270},{"text":"when you see & it means that I don't want to know about the variable itself, but where it is stored in memory","width":523},{"text":"tell me the address of the variable","width":305},{"text":"we didn't need this for arrays because that's what the array name gives us automatically","width":224},{"text":"but for other items we can use the & to find out where it is stored in memory","width":500},{"text":"let's compile and run it","width":374},{"text":"and we find out that my little virtual machine thinks it's Jan 1 2014","width":389},{"text":"not very accurate, we should probably change it, but it did print out what it thinks the current time","width":487},{"text":"I promised you that I'd mention a few more mistakes that we can make with heap memory","width":479},{"text":"one mistake we can make is to double free the same pointer","width":423},{"text":"this can lead to all sorts of horrendous problems because when you tell the heap that you've freed with some memory it might actually use that memory for it's own book keeping","width":719},{"text":"so it knows that the particular block of memory is free","width":275},{"text":"if you free it again it can confuse the book keeping, the pointers that the heap is using itself","width":684},{"text":"once we've freed some memory, dont free it by accident a second time!","width":208},{"text":"another common mistake in C programs is to continue using memory after we've freed it","width":536},{"text":"we shouldn't consider that memory to be valid anymore","width":175},{"text":"perhaps it's going to be reused by some other part of the program that is about to call malloc()","width":458},{"text":"and certainly we shouldn't expect anything that we've previously stored in there to be valid","width":469},{"text":"once we've freed it don't try to use the pointer again","width":188},{"text":"so for example, this would be an error","width":217},{"text":"so how can we guard against some of these errors?","width":199},{"text":"one common defensive programming technique is once we free a pointer set that pointer to be NULL","width":498},{"text":"to mean that I'm not pointing to anything anymore","width":212},{"text":"so this avoids the problem of what is called a dangling pointer error","width":429},{"text":"that now our pointer is no longer pointing to invalid memory","width":541},{"text":"that's it for me. time for you

parts","width":170},{"text":"the components of my struct","width":119},{"text":"and i will call that say result and i need to initialize my pointer","width":481},{"text":"so now i've got that I can set the key to be a key and the value to be the value","width":499},{"text":"now when i do this i am copying the pointers i'm not creating new strings","width":444},{"text":"so in other words i've now got a pointer called key and it's looking at exactly the same string array as the parameter is","width":499},{"text":"i haven't made any new string arrays","width":203},{"text":"so let's remember that when i return this","width":214},{"text":"that those pointers better be valid for the lifetime of the link","width":288},{"text":"well that's fine if I knew for example that this will always be used with string constants or I am taking control of those values that I send in and I happen to know that their lifetime is longer than the link's lifetime","width":1068},{"text":"so if that's the case then my code is relatively simple like this","width":214},{"text":"and destroying the link is also relatively simple","width":225},{"text":"so let's write a link destroy method destroy","width":205},{"text":"which takes a pointer to the link that is going to disappear so we can call that just p","width":437},{"text":"and what do i need to do in here","width":104},{"text":"well i can simply return the memory back","width":190},{"text":"okay so this works we could do a little better than this","width":253},{"text":"we could actually do some defensive programming here","width":150},{"text":"where we also destroy the information inside that link","width":381},{"text":"so for that i can use memory set","width":190},{"text":"so memset where I give it a pointer that I want to use","width":325},{"text":"the value will be zero the number of bytes can be the size of my link","width":279},{"text":"so this assures that i don't have any dangling pointers","width":258},{"text":"i have destroyed the key and value pointers","width":232},{"text":"i've set them back to null and anything else inside my link has been set to null","width":247},{"text":"so if someone happens to have a pointer to this link and they try to use the contents straight away then it will fail it will be null","width":521},{"text":"and secondly we are freeing it to say okay this memory can now be reused for other purposes","width":356},{"text":"so that's my link destroy method","width":158},{"text":"now suppose we discover that our strings we don't control the lifetime of these string arrays","width":483},{"text":"and that actually we should make copies of them","width":186},{"text":"so how can i do that","width":89},{"text":"well there's a method called strdup so let's do that strdup and this gives me back a pointer to a new string ","width":697},{"text":"a new character array that has been created on the heap","width":223},{"text":"and it's just a copy of that existing character array that we passed it","width":296},{"text":"so let's create our new string arrays and use those","width":296},{"text":"if we do that then when I destroy the link I better free up the memory associated with my key and value","width":470},{"text":"so before ending here I should free up those pointers","width":344},{"text":"so I should call free on my key and free on my value pointer as well","width":641},{"text":"okay so there's my code now to start working with a link","width":780},{"text":"with my main method I will need to always know the beginning of my linked list","width":448},{"text":"so that sounds like a great thing to actually have as a global variable here","width":312},{"text":"so let me have my link pointer here and I can call it root","width":327},{"text":"and so the first link I make I can initialize root to that","width":316},{"text":"to that very first link","width":157},{"text":"okay so that's it for now, it's now time for you to play with creating more links","width":389},{"text":"bye","width":70}],

   [{"text":"hello welcome","width":63},{"text":"let's talk about how we can get single characters and print them out in c","width":267},{"text":"so here's some functions defined in std.io","width":232},{"text":"i can say give me a single character for example and why don't I just keep calling this","width":400},{"text":"so i could just say while getchar is not equal to a special constant called end of file (EOF) keep going around in a loop","width":590},{"text":"but if I actually want to print them out I better actually store the value of getchar","width":232},{"text":"so let's have an integer value called c and inside my while condition I'm actually going to assign the result into c","width":544},{"text":"so you'll often see this pattern inside systems programming where we take a systems call or a library call and we store the results inside a variable","width":643},{"text":"but because that may also signify an error condition or a termination condition we use it immediately to check inside part of a while loop or an if statement","width":641},{"text":"so we've got a little character loop here that is going to keep going until it gets to the end of the file","width":254},{"text":"so now I want to print it out","width":92},{"text":"guess what i can call putchar and we'll see that running ","width":217},{"text":"so let's run this little program","width":264},{"text":"ABCD","width":90},{"text":"it prints back ABCD","width":147},{"text":"okay so we don't have to display the character just as a character","width":273},{"text":"we can display it as a character an integer and hexdecimal values","width":255},{"text":"so let's use printf for that","width":94},{"text":"so I've got %c %d and %c for character integer and hexadecimal value","width":376},{"text":"alright so let's run this","width":324},{"text":"and you can see that the letter A corresponds to sixty five which is in hexadecimal forty one","width":385},{"text":"right so why don't we use our little program to print out the contents of another file","width":433},{"text":"so if I cat my source code I can see the contents of that","width":292},{"text":"great so I'm going to pipe it into my program","width":273},{"text":"so i'll do ./program and it reads every byte and prints it out as a character","width":526},{"text":"great so let's encrypt our file now so I'm going to modify our value of c if it's not a newline character","width":533},{"text":"so what we'll do is say if c is at least thirty two in other words at least a space an ascii space","width":470},{"text":"and if it is we will change the lowest bit","width":382},{"text":"we'll flip the lowest bit","width":61},{"text":"how can we do that","width":64},{"text":"let's xor it with one","width":169},{"text":"right and then we'll print it out","width":147},{"text":"okay so we'll run this","width":172},{"text":"CDE for example and it changed the C to a B","width":281},{"text":"and if I do 135 I get 024","width":254},{"text":"so to say that I've got to the end of the file when I'm just typing you by the way you can do control d","width":374},{"text":"now see this working on some actual source code","width":226},{"text":"so let's here some text my program.c and i'm going to pipe that into my program to use as its input","width":524},{"text":"and you can see great we've garbled the program","width":264},{"text":"so if I want to I can then take that output and pipe it into my program again","width":444},{"text":"so now i'm going to unencrypt it because i flipped the lowest bit back  ","width":259},{"text":"so we get back our source code","width":133},{"text":"so that's getchar and putchar i can also work with whole lines","width":372},{"text":"i can let's get rid of the loop here i can say puts hello or any pointer to a character array provided its terminated by a zero byte at the end","width":997},{"text":"and that is equivalent to printf by saying %s and \\n at the end","width":560},{"text":"so i've got some character pointer here","width":279},{"text":"right so it's a little bit shorter to type than writing printf","width":480},{"text":"there is the opposite which is to get some input","width":225},{"text":"but this has a problem and we'll see why in a moment why this function actually call is being removed from the c standard","width":392},{"text":"i'm talking about gets so let's call gets and we will have a little buffer here","width":648},{"text":"so let's put a little buffer on the stack here","width":187},{"text":"i'll make it twelve bytes today ","width":109},{"text":"and remember when we call gets with buffer if you use the array name you are talking about the very first byte of the array","width":432},{"text":"and rather than printing out hello","width":175},{"text":"we will print out our buffer value","width":137},{"text":"so let's run this and we can type something in and it echos it back to us","width":509},{"text":"fantastic but what happens if we enter more than twelve bytes","width":262},{"text":"so in other words could something bad happen to our other variables","width":247},{"text":"well yes it could because if we go past twelve bytes we start writing into memory which is used for other purposes","width":353},{"text":"for example in my little program the integer is immediately after the buffer","width":378},{"text":"let's prove this let's set our hex value of c to be ten twenty thirty fourty","width":422},{"text":"let me print that out after we've called gets i'm going to print it again","width":584},{"text":"so we've got to remember that what we store is going to be our letters plus a null byte","width":475},{"text":"so in this case if I do ABCDABCDABCD I've already overflowed because the thirteenth byte is now going to be written into my integer","width":796},{"text":"but i am going to do just a few more I'll do ABCD there we go","width":295},{"text":"and we'll see that I've managed to change my integer value to 41424344","width":412},{"text":"so the last ABC that I wrote in there actually overran my buffer","width":277},{"text":"i've got a buffer overflow and I've corrupted the contents of another variable","width":300},{"text":"so that's why gets is dangerous","width":107},{"text":"there's no way to tell gets that we shouldn't accept input that is too long for it","width":420},{"text":"so in a future video i'll tell you about getline and also fgets which don't suffer from these problems","width":586},{"text":"okay that's it for me thanks for watching and i'll see you in another video.

  [{"text":"Hello! Let's talk about how we can use scanf and sscanf and fscanf to read some data and convert that into say integers or floats or strings","width":739},{"text":"so we can actually use those values inside our variables","width":232},{"text":"alright, so, I'll start by using sscanf","width":207},{"text":"which can parse data inside a string","width":184},{"text":"inside memory","width":109},{"text":"so for example, let's have a little bit of data here","width":136},{"text":"I'll have my data be my name and a score","width":454},{"text":"and I want to take that and pull it apart into a string and an integer","width":385},{"text":"so I'll have a little buffer here, say, up to twenty characters","width":343},{"text":"and a little integer here","width":102},{"text":"and I could set this to be equal to some arbitrary value. we'll see why in a little bit","width":434},{"text":"and then I'm going to say \"okay, sscanf please read from this string array and what I'd like you to do is convert that into a string followed by one or more spaces and then an integer value\"","width":1146},{"text":"alright so scanf is going to look at our memory starting at wherever our data is pointing at","width":359},{"text":"and, it's going to first of all look for a string until it comes across one space","width":357},{"text":"and then there can be actually multiple spaces in our data","width":155},{"text":"and then after that, it's going to treat the rest of the string as an integer","width":287},{"text":"okay, now, our format specifiers say the kind of data that we want to interpret and also the number of bytes that should be written to when it is trying to parse its data","width":730},{"text":"so we better tell it where to exactly put these things","width":154},{"text":"so for our string, we want it to write it into a buffer","width":234},{"text":"and for the score, we want to write it into our score variable","width":199},{"text":"but hold on a moment","width":114},{"text":"when we say \"buffer\" yes that gives us the beginning address of our array","width":372},{"text":"but not for score","width":63},{"text":"score is just going to give us whatever value score happens to hold","width":170},{"text":"in this case, negative forty two","width":124},{"text":"that's not what we need","width":69},{"text":"we actually want the address of this variable","width":132},{"text":"so we're going to say ampersand score","width":239},{"text":"so, lets read that and we'll print it out","width":271},{"text":"so here's the result and we'll say %s %d and we'll print the contents of the buffer and print the value of score","width":592},{"text":"so notice that scanf and printf, the arguments don't always look the same","width":266},{"text":"when we want to print out the values, we don't actually want to just print out the address of score","width":389},{"text":"we actually wanted to know what the value is","width":106},{"text":"great so that read that correctly","width":202},{"text":"scanf actually tells us something else which is how many arguments it correctly managed to parse","width":428},{"text":"so let's make a note of that and we'll print that out","width":299},{"text":"so, we'll say %d here","width":313},{"text":"print out the result in our printf statement here","width":183},{"text":"so now when we run it, we'll see that sscanf managed to read both iterms","width":384},{"text":"I got result two","width":90},{"text":"fantastic. so that's useful. now we can write robust programs to check if we really did write into both variables","width":521},{"text":"now you might be worried that scanf could result in a buffer overflow","width":286},{"text":"and, in fact, in our current code, you'd be right","width":168},{"text":"so if I had a very long name with no spaces here","width":419},{"text":"then that's longer than our buffer","width":229},{"text":"so what we need to do is tell scanf just how big our buffer is","width":209},{"text":"so in this case, it should be nineteen","width":207},{"text":"because we're setting scanf how many character to read from the input","width":321},{"text":"and our buffer, of course, if going to need one extra one to hold the terminating byte for this string","width":397},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":483},{"text":"and you'll see that first of all the name is truncated and that secondly, the return value of our scanf call here was one","width":538},{"text":"and it only managed to read into the buffer","width":259},{"text":"it gave up trying to read the integer because our buffer wasn't long enough","width":190},{"text":"and, in fact, our score variable still contained its original value","width":305},{"text":"of negative forty two","width":123},{"text":"so good defensive programs must check that the return value is reasonable","width":389},{"text":"also, when writing scanf or sscanf or fscanf, it's always a good idea to carefully check to see whether you should be looking at the address of the variable or if the variable itself actually is a pointer","width":783},{"text":"and is already going to give you the memory address that you'd like scanf to change","width":532},{"text":"alright so we've read data from a string ","width":263},{"text":"we can also parse data from a file stream and how can we do that? well you can use not sscanf but fscanf","width":663},{"text":"and if you did that, you better give it a file stream","width":182},{"text":"there's one called stdin already","width":209},{"text":"if we didn't want to use that, then we could open up a file using fopen and then pass in the file handle here","width":564},{"text":"and reading from stdin is such a common occurance that in fact there's another form of this which is just say scanf","width":699},{"text":"and if you do that, that means \"hey, just read from stdin\"","width":188},{"text":"so now, let's run our program here","width":555},{"text":"and, now it's waiting for input","width":99},{"text":"so let me typing something","width":130},{"text":"I'll say \"Angrave one hundred\"","width":324},{"text":"great! and it managed to parse both variables","width":177},{"text":"okay so that's enough introduction to scanf","width":188},{"text":"remember this next time you're trying to read 3d data and points and you want to say convert those ASCII numbers into actual floats and doubles","width":640},{"text":"and also remember that its important to read exactly how scanf uses these format specifiers because its not quite the same as printf","width":624},{"text":"alright, that's it for me. time for you to play.

  [{"text":"hello welcome","width":111},{"text":"let's talk about getline","width":93},{"text":"so it's very very common to read in a single line of text either from the user or from a file","width":438},{"text":"and we would like it to be very easy to say hey \"let's not worry about making sure my buffer is large enough\"","width":384},{"text":"I just want to get the whole line","width":95},{"text":"and thus getline was born","width":130},{"text":"this is being adopted into the posix standard","width":215},{"text":"if you are working however with older standard and an older compiler we have to ask gcc to explicitly enable it","width":463},{"text":"so before doing our includes with stdio we need to define _GNU_SOURCE","width":575},{"text":"so if we do that we would like the gnu source additions to the standard functions","width":473},{"text":"right so if we do that now we have got a getline declaration included as part of the #include <stdio.h>","width":478},{"text":"so here is how we can use getline","width":228},{"text":"with getline we actually set up two variables","width":284},{"text":"we get getline to manipulate these directly ","width":287},{"text":"we are going to have a pointer to a buffer","width":319},{"text":"and a little int to say how big is our buffer","width":369},{"text":"well let's just check to see really if it is an int or if we should be doing a different type","width":226},{"text":"so let me pull up my favorite manpage on getline","width":362},{"text":"see that actually the correct type to use is size_t","width":398},{"text":"which is essentially an unsigned int or larger on some systems","width":259},{"text":"so let's just make a note of that","width":99},{"text":"that is the declaration that we are going to be using","width":210},{"text":"and so we will have not just a buffer to our character array","width":377},{"text":"but also size as well to say how big is our buffer","width":328},{"text":"and i will call this say capacity","width":168},{"text":"right so we could start calling this and we could say okay","width":256},{"text":"get me a line and oh i need to pass in a pointer to my buffer variable","width":441},{"text":"right and notice that the declaration here is star star asteric so it's a pointer to a pointer","width":513},{"text":"right so how did i get that","width":97},{"text":"i say okay give me the address of my variable","width":223},{"text":"and similarly for the capacity as well","width":150},{"text":"the size of the variable","width":126},{"text":"so give me the address of my capacity","width":317},{"text":"and getline is going to modify those two variables directly","width":222},{"text":"essentially if my buffer is not large enough","width":189},{"text":"it is going to free up the old buffer and then call malloc so that we get a larger buffer","width":518},{"text":"okay technically it might call realloc but let's not worry about exactly which library call it calls","width":335},{"text":"we just know that it's going to do all that buffer maintenance for us automatically","width":266},{"text":"and now we need to give it a filestream so why don't we use say stdin","width":413},{"text":"now right now our code suffers from a terrible flaw which is that we've assumed that our automatic variables buffer capacity will be set to nothing","width":546},{"text":"so the getline knows that it can't reuse what it happens to be pointing to","width":264},{"text":"so we actually need to set these to explicitly to null and the capacity to zero","width":403},{"text":"so the first time we call getline getline will see that the buffer is certainly not large enough and will allocate enough space","width":502},{"text":"we can now find out what the result is which is the number of characters getline has managed to retrieve","width":519},{"text":"or a negative value if it failed","width":127},{"text":"so let's make a note of that","width":146},{"text":"and we'll print this out","width":125},{"text":"so i'll print it out as an integer and let's have a look to see what we can find inside our buffer","width":445},{"text":"so we want the result and we want the buffer","width":227},{"text":"and lastly let's put a newline here","width":169},{"text":"okay so we'll run our little program here","width":385},{"text":"and now it's waiting for me to type something","width":368},{"text":"okay great so it says i have got six characters","width":218},{"text":"wait and i printed ABCDE","width":102},{"text":"actually the last character might be a newline character","width":355},{"text":"and quite often we don't actually need that","width":152},{"text":"so why don't we overwrite the very last character with null with a terminating byte","width":439},{"text":"so let's write the code for that","width":160},{"text":"first of all we only want to do that if we get at least one character back from getline","width":289},{"text":"so let's check that the result was positive","width":300},{"text":"and also we only want to do this if we are going to overwrite the last character which truly is a newline","width":385},{"text":"we could imagine for example reading from a file where the very last byte is not actually a newline","width":363},{"text":"so we should just check to see what we're going to write here","width":233},{"text":"so let's look inside our buffer and where do we want to look?","width":275},{"text":"well if we read one character that would be at the beginning of the buffer","width":403},{"text":"so we need to look at result minus one","width":129},{"text":"so if that is equal to the character of a newline","width":352},{"text":"then let's truncate the string","width":262},{"text":"the easiest way to do that remember is strings are just terminated by zero","width":190},{"text":"so let's just put a zero directly into that byte","width":188},{"text":"so we are going to say at the same spot set that equal to zero","width":356},{"text":"right so let's run our program again","width":534},{"text":"okay so this time it read it correctly and in our printf we didn't get that unwanted extra newline","width":570},{"text":"alright our program right now is allocating memory on the heap","width":270},{"text":"we don't do it we let getline do it","width":127},{"text":"but it's actually up to us when we finish using getline to free that buffer","width":362},{"text":"right so let's do that","width":121},{"text":"let's at the very end here we can call free on the buffer","width":316},{"text":"we don't need to do that every time we call getline because getline by default will try to for performance try to reuse the buffer for each line it gets","width":576},{"text":"so for example we could call getline twice and it would try to use the same buffer","width":511},{"text":"but the big take home message for getline is first of all","width":186},{"text":"you are going to need a pointer to a buffer and a capacity variacle which getline itself is going to change the contents of","width":470},{"text":"as you call it it can make the buffer as large as","width":304},{"text":"each time you call getline it might change that buffer to point to some new memory if the buffer needs to be larger","width":439},{"text":"secondly it's a great idea to check the return value of getline to see how many characters it managed to read","width":469},{"text":"and also to see if there was an error or not","width":138},{"text":"and the return type for that is ssize_t for a signed size integer type","width":469},{"text":"and finally it's good practice to don't forget to free the memory that is

  [{"text":"Hello welcome","width":135},{"text":"so this video is a little introduction to signals","width":222},{"text":"so signals are like a software interrupt","width":198},{"text":"we can use them to control our processes and even do things asynchronously","width":322},{"text":"so let's have a look at a little program i have written so far that doesn't use signals yet","width":333},{"text":"all it does is ask for the environment of home","width":181},{"text":"in other words the user's home directory","width":172},{"text":"and then we have a little loop that prints it out and sleeps for three seconds","width":314},{"text":"so every three seconds it is going to print out my home directory","width":211},{"text":"and on this machine i am root so it just keeps on printing out slash root","width":387},{"text":"so of course we can stop this program by pressing control c","width":383},{"text":"and when you do that you actually are sending a signal","width":195},{"text":"sigint or sig interrupt to the process","width":261},{"text":"now it maybe that our process doesn't like being interrupted","width":198},{"text":"why don't we catch that signal and install our own little handle for that","width":319},{"text":"so here is how we will do this","width":158},{"text":"i am going to say at the beginning of my program that if you get a certain signal say sigint ","width":797},{"text":"rather than having the default behavior which as we know is to stop the program or quit the program","width":367},{"text":"let us run my code instead","width":113},{"text":"so i will call it say nothankyou","width":227},{"text":"so what is nothankyou","width":113},{"text":"it has to be a pointer to a function","width":252},{"text":"how do we do that","width":61},{"text":"easy just write a function","width":75},{"text":"and in this case the correct type is something that doesn't return anything","width":310},{"text":"but does take an integer","width":136},{"text":"in fact it is the signal that is being sent to our program","width":253},{"text":"and so that we know that this is being called let's write something out directly to standard output","width":342},{"text":"so i can say write and i can say no","width":219},{"text":"so what is that that is a little message of three bytes to send","width":228},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":155},{"text":"okay so here is my program every three seconds it is going to print root","width":248},{"text":"but now i am going to press control c","width":359},{"text":"and it prints no no so it's refusing to quit","width":405},{"text":"you might also notice that the sleep also immediately returns","width":242},{"text":"more about that later","width":99},{"text":"it is still possible to stop our program here","width":180},{"text":"if we do control backslash then we force it to quit","width":382},{"text":"so sigint is one common signal that we send our programs","width":259},{"text":"there are many others","width":92},{"text":"just for fun let me show you one called sigalarm","width":239},{"text":"so this time i am going to say alarm seven seconds","width":498},{"text":"and so when you call alarm you are going to say give me a special signal called sigalrm in this many seconds","width":626},{"text":"in seven seconds","width":82},{"text":"and we better install then","width":112},{"text":"well let's just run it and see what happens to begin with","width":795},{"text":"so the default behavior of this sigalrm is to actually stop our program","width":299},{"text":"it quits the program","width":103},{"text":"that's a pretty aggressive alarm clock i think you'll agree","width":175},{"text":"and it also as you see prints out alarm clock on the shell","width":233},{"text":"perhaps we don't want our alarm signal to be so menacing","width":308},{"text":"so this time instead of sigint i can say look for a certain signal called sigalrm","width":452},{"text":"please call my function instead","width":515},{"text":"okay so there we go our alarm went off after four seconds and this time we asynchronously ran our code that printed out no to standard out","width":704},{"text":"so this is pretty exciting right","width":98},{"text":"you probably thought about interrupts on the hardware level","width":228},{"text":"now we can do interrupts at the software level and we can respond to things which happen in our environment very quickly","width":459},{"text":"so we will find signals to be very useful when we start dealing working with more than one process","width":381},{"text":"we can control our programs and we can also work with very large amounts of data coming in","width":371},{"text":"alright that is enough for me","width":106},{"text":"bye","width":36}],

  [{"text":"so usually we think about our programs as just turning into one single process","width":299},{"text":"now i am going to show you some systems programming magic","width":187},{"text":"where actually we can turn our single process into two","width":217},{"text":"here is how we are going to do it","width":105},{"text":"let us have a very simple program that says hello world","width":216},{"text":"and here it is","width":138},{"text":"so between these two lines however","width":198},{"text":"i am going to call fork","width":426},{"text":"and here's a surprise","width":91},{"text":"we get hello world world","width":90},{"text":"yes we get two worlds","width":129},{"text":"why is that","width":65},{"text":"well at the beginning there was a single process","width":117},{"text":"but then we called fork and now our single process is actually being cloned","width":340},{"text":"it has been split into two","width":111},{"text":"so both the processes print out world","width":164},{"text":"and so we see both their output on our little terminal here","width":297},{"text":"okay what else can we do with this","width":97},{"text":"well let us first of all show that there really are two different processes","width":192},{"text":"i am going to look at their processor id","width":351},{"text":"and we will print it out","width":168},{"text":"so i will call getpid()","width":102},{"text":"and you will see that yeah i have got two different processes","width":258},{"text":"both trying to run at the same time","width":191},{"text":"in fact i have got a parent child relationship here","width":289},{"text":"i have got the original process","width":128},{"text":"the parent","width":63},{"text":"and you can think of fork as saying let us clone this original process right here right now","width":375},{"text":"so that i get a child that looks just like me","width":153},{"text":"or at least almost like me","width":111},{"text":"in many many respects","width":63},{"text":"it is the same memory","width":152},{"text":"it has got it's own variables","width":63},{"text":"but because its got its own address space","width":251},{"text":"what the child now does in terms of its memory is seperate from the parents","width":369},{"text":"okay so let's show you what we can then do with this","width":330},{"text":"first of all fork actually returns something here","width":154},{"text":"it actually returns back an id","width":192},{"text":"so let's make a note of that","width":188},{"text":"and we'll print it out","width":124},{"text":"so we'll say %d and we'll print out just here","width":552},{"text":"okay so here is what we see","width":166},{"text":"that the process id 681 has fork value of 682","width":562},{"text":"and process 682 has a fork return value of 0","width":386},{"text":"so the fork value is different for the parent and the child","width":290},{"text":"and in fact fork","width":173},{"text":"if it returns a positive number is talking to the parent","width":238},{"text":"and is telling the parent here is the id number for your child","width":333},{"text":"so let us make a note of that","width":162},{"text":"let us call this","width":75},{"text":"here is my child","width":63},{"text":"so i can call my child","width":149},{"text":"and then i can write an if statement to decide if i am the parent or the newly created child or not","width":466},{"text":"so we will say look if the child id what i return from fork is actually greater than 0","width":470},{"text":"then i am the parent","width":194},{"text":"so let's put something like hey i'm the grouchy parent","width":575},{"text":"if it is zero however then hey I'm the carefree child!","width":905},{"text":"so we will let's remove this ","width":254},{"text":"i'll get rid of that line now","width":83},{"text":"okay so now we have a little program where the parent and child are going to do two different things","width":381},{"text":"and in fact it is standard for the parent to wait for the child to finish","width":438},{"text":"we don't have to but quite often we need the child process to do something for us","width":436},{"text":"perhaps in the background","width":112},{"text":"but we don't actually want to continue until the child has finished","width":234},{"text":"so let us do that","width":88},{"text":"what i am going to wait for my child to finish","width":262},{"text":"so i am going to say waitpid and i need to say okay what is the id i need to wait on well here is the childid","width":566},{"text":"and later on i can ask for some status information about my child","width":345},{"text":"and for now the last argument i am just going to put as 0","width":189},{"text":"so i need to have a variable called status just a little integer","width":299},{"text":"and in fact we are going to pass not just the value of status but the address of our little variable","width":400},{"text":"and later on we can use that to find out say did our child exit normally or was it terminated in a surprising way","width":492},{"text":"so let us run this now and what we will expect to see is that we'll wait for the child to finish before we print","width":519},{"text":"I'm the grouchy parent","width":63},{"text":"so let's run this","width":393},{"text":"okay so this time the child process got to print out I'm the carefree child","width":442},{"text":"then it exited","width":119},{"text":"meanwhile the parent was waiting for the async condition and when that happened","width":342},{"text":"the parent is able to continue and is able to print I'm the grouchy parent","width":416},{"text":"so i want to finish on a common programming error that can really bring down a server","width":564},{"text":"and that is suppose we made many many many processes","width":406},{"text":"so it is one thing to create a few","width":142},{"text":"let's call say fork a couple of times and perhaps you can guess how many worlds we'll see here","width":971},{"text":"that's right we see four worlds","width":146},{"text":"and in fact the parent finished early so this is the hash of the terminal saying what would you like to do now","width":540},{"text":"but we had four processes all printing out world","width":212},{"text":"and if we had three forks now we have eight","width":311},{"text":"okay so let us make something now called a fork bomb which is where we keep creating lots and lots of processes","width":550},{"text":"and this often happens by accident by people who are new to systems programming","width":326},{"text":"but just for fun because i am just doing this inside a browser it doesn't matter if i bring my little virtual machine to a halt","width":582},{"text":"i can always just reload the page","width":114},{"text":"so let's print out my id","width":630},{"text":"i will put this in a little loop that says while one let's fork","width":327},{"text":"let's print out my process id","width":347},{"text":"and then i will sleep two seconds","width":460},{"text":"so initially i have two processes","width":111},{"text":"and then each of those processes calls fork","width":209},{"text":"so we got four","width":51},{"text":"and then each of those processes call fork","width":171},{"text":"prints it out and sleeps","width":93},{"text":"and so every two seconds i am doubling the number of processes that are in my system","width":291},{"text":"so that's a lot of processes","width":124},{"text":"and in fact pretty soon the kernel will run out of space","width":324},{"text":"it won't be able to keep track of any more processes","width":138},{"text":"and fork will stop working","width":220},{"text":"and now we see here's the kernel printing out all sorts of debug messages","width":248},{"text":"desperately trying to make the system stable again","width":190},{"text":"as it arbitrarily starts to kill processes in an attempt to recover some memory and space in its process tables","width":539},{"text":"so amazingly my little kernel here has managed to recover to the point to where i have a working system","width":500},{"text":"but that is fork bombs and you should avoid from accidentally doing this","width":346},{"text":"otherwise you will have a system administrator telling you that you cannot log onto that machine anymore","width":286},{"text":"okay have fun and i'll see you in the next video","width":194},{"text":"bye","width":39}],
