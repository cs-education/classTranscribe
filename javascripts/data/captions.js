that are noteworthy here is first of all they have different sizes","width":303},{"text":"so let's look at the sizes of each of these, perhaps you can guess what the result is going to be","width":405},{"text":"so you'll see the size of the pointer is the number of bytes to actually hold the character pointer","width":307},{"text":"which as this is a 32-bit machine is four bytes","width":226},{"text":"the size of array is the total size required to hold the whole array","width":420},{"text":"so when this code runs it's actually going to copy the contents of that string literal \"hello world\" into the new array object","width":564},{"text":"so in this case we need twelve bytes for that, eleven for \"hello world\" plus a twelfth to hold the null character at the end the bit pattern zero to say okay we've reached the end of the string","width":769},{"text":"their sizes is very different, plus remember that because we've made additional memory on the stack","width":496},{"text":"we can change it so I can change it to \"jello world\" for example","width":272},{"text":"let's start manipulating our string","width":234},{"text":"we'll do this on our array so we can actually make modifications to it","width":240},{"text":"how about we change all the 'l's to a different letter","width":242},{"text":"so we'll change and we'll pass the beggining of the array","width":255},{"text":"so let's pass in the array and afterwards we'll print what the array is so that's %s","width":985},{"text":"alright so I'll have my function called change down here and it takes a pointer to that memory","width":378},{"text":"so we don't need to return anything because we are actually going to be using the parameter to point to some memory that we are going to change","width":506},{"text":"what can we do with this?","width":121},{"text":"well let's have a little loop that says while(p) that says while p is non zero","width":433},{"text":"actually what we care about is whether p is pointing to memory that holds zero","width":316},{"text":"in other words, we've reached the end of the string","width":142},{"text":"we want to follow the pointer we want to dereference the pointer and for that we need the asterisk","width":290},{"text":"okay so what should we do with this. well we could change all of the letters","width":429},{"text":"for example we could blank it out","width":173},{"text":"we could say star p equals","width":147},{"text":"and it might be tempting to write an astericks here","width":376},{"text":"but that's not right because the

let's see if my p is, at when I look at that memory location, whether it's a lowercase l","width":594},{"text":"and as I said before because we are working with characters it is ok to compare them so note the use of double equals here","width":553},{"text":"okay so let's run that","width":341},{"text":"we have a couple of errors here","width":204},{"text":"for starters we're not using pointer","width":150},{"text":"so I can comment out that line","width":111},{"text":"I've got another problem here which is that change is implicitly declared","width":289},{"text":"that's because we haven't declared what the function signature of change() looks like","width":301},{"text":"let's do that now","width":89},{"text":"I'm going to say later on compiler, I expect to actually define a function and I'll give you the actual code to create this change method","width":700},{"text":"but for now here is what it's signature looks like","width":153},{"text":"it's called change, it takes a pointer to a character and it doesn't return anything","width":272},{"text":"so if I compile that now my warnings should go away","width":283},{"text":"great so I've got a function that can walk through","width":402},{"text":"I could have another function that finds letters as well","width":186},{"text":"so for example suppose we wanted to find the first o in this","width":503},{"text":"I could change this so that rather than changing the letters","width":413},{"text":"if the contents of p is an 'o', let's return p","width":466},{"text":"now I'm going to change my method signature","width":243},{"text":"and I'd better have a return value that returns something if I get to the very end","width":338},{"text":"so for example, it returns where p is","width":324},{"text":"we can now update my original code so that it finds the first 'o' and gives you back a pointer to that","width":876},{"text":"if I print that out","width":93},{"text":"hopefully you can guess what my program should do","width":407},{"text":"okay so it gave us back a string and it this time the pointer was half way through \"hello world\"","width":453},{"text":"that's OK, our pointers don't care what they point to","width":278},{"text":"we know that strings will continue until we reach the null byte at the

Let's talk about automatic variables","width":204},{"text":"so here's my main method I've got two function calls f1 f2","width":328},{"text":"and today I'm going to actually define them before my main method","width":266},{"text":"so I don't need to put in the additional declares in","width":211},{"text":"so let's have f1 here and f2...ok","width":353},{"text":"so now I've got a syntactically correct program","width":257},{"text":"but I want to talk about the variables that we might put inside these","width":182},{"text":"so if I create a variable like this to say \"hey I've got a value here, something I need to compute inside f1\" or maybe I want to make an array","width":718},{"text":"so here's my array and I can initialize it to, say, \"f1f1\" here we go","width":529},{"text":"then the lifetime of my array (this variable) is only for the lifetime of the function","width":456},{"text":"when I return from f1, then the variable goes out of scope","width":307},{"text":"which means the name \"array\" doesn't mean anything anymore inside our program","width":271},{"text":"but secondly, the memory that we were using for the array is automatically free'd up","width":298},{"text":"it can be reused for other purposes in a moment by the rest of the program","width":197},{"text":"so isn't that fantastic","width":131},{"text":"that's why it's called an automatic variable","width":160},{"text":"so automatic variables are very easy to use","width":140},{"text":"they also come with a big warning sticker and that's this","width":273},{"text":"which is to be very wary of just how long they live for","width":440},{"text":"let's do a couple of things here","width":126},{"text":"first of all, let's make it so that we can actually see the pointer in memory where array is pointing to","width":671},{"text":"so, let's print that out inside our function here","width":341},{"text":"remember that the name of the array (when converted to address) gives us the very beginning of the array","width":400},{"text":"and, we'll do that for our second function too","width":172},{"text":"okay, so, f2 f2","width":220},{"text":"just to prove that they're making different arrays","width":215},{"text":"okay, so we'll compile and run this","width":190},{"text":"and, when we run it, we see that both f1 and f2 both these functions the array is actually stored inside the same memory location","width":864},{"text":"isn't that fantastic. we didn't need any additional memory","width":155},{"text":"and that's because after we return from f1, any of those automatic variables are free'd so they are no longer needed so we can reuse that space","width":598},{"text":"internally, later we'll discover that a stack data structure is used to implement this","width":497},{"text":"and I can show a little bit of this by having a either a recursive function or we can make another function call these","width":611},{"text":"so for example, I could have a function called eg","width":421},{"text":"and, this calls f1","width":146},{"text":"so now let's have a look in the case that I'm not using f2 anymore","width":363},{"text":"so that can go away","width":180},{"text":"instead, I've got a function called eg and that can say have its own space","width":365},{"text":"so, blah and maybe say a thousand and twenty four bytes here","width":571},{"text":"and then we call f1 again","width":142},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":474},{"text":"so, in the output, you'll see that f1 is printed twice and the second time it's because it's being called from our function eg","width":784},{"text":"and in this case, it's further down in the stack. it's in lower memory","width":348},{"text":"f948 as opposed to fd50","width":154},{"text":"because it's being called from eg","width":335},{"text":"so, we'll see more about the stack in a moment","width":162},{"text":"later on. I just wanted to show you that they really are stored in different places","width":326},{"text":"finally, to reinforce this idea, let's make a little recursive function","width":348},{"text":"so, I can have something which takes an integer say I'll call it \"level\"","width":488},{"text":"and if level is greater than zero, let's call ourselves again with a slightly reduced value","width":667},{"text":"and I can of course make that simpler by just saying \"if level\"","width":272},{"text":"so if level is nonzero, then call it again","width":125},{"text":"and let's call it with say five","width":178},{"text":"okay, a semicolon would help","width":303},{"text":"each case as we go deeper and deeper into recursion, our array is getting lower and lower and lower in memory","width":587},{"text":"so we have all of these arrays created. all of these different activation records in different places","width":370},{"text":"inside our processes's memory","width":181},{"text":"so the last point we'll make, which is the most important, which is that it's very dangerous to return pointers to memory that is no longer valid","width":472},{"text":"for example, rather than returning nothing returning void, suppose we try to return a pointer to our array","width":659},{"text":"then though this code might compile, okay, I can get rid of \"level\" now","width":557},{"text":"it's certainly not a valid program because the pointer we get back from f1 now points to stale memory","width":631},{"text":"that memory is no longer ours to control","width":167},{"text":"it will be used in a moment for other function calls","width":182},{"text":"so always be careful if you are returning a pointer to something. make sure that that memory is still valid","width":413},{"text":"and never return a pointer to an automatic variable","width":208},{"text":"that's it for me. time for you to play. bye!","width":187}],

  [{"text":"hi welcome","width":116},{"text":"so we have got a little function so far called currenttime()","width":136},{"text":"that requests 128 bytes from the heap","width":307},{"text":"and then providing we get a non-null pointer back from malloc","width":263},{"text":"we will copy in the time 2:51 PM into that memory","width":288},{"text":"and then return a pointer to the first byte of that memory so that's our little currenttime","width":262},{"text":"we've been careful to make sure that if malloc fails, perhaps our program has used all of the heap memory","width":411},{"text":"then we don't try to use that null pointer","width":207},{"text":"but now let's actually make it so that it actually makes a call to find out what the current time is","width":540},{"text":"the current time is known by the system","width":114},{"text":"so it's time to make a system call and then we will format that using a c function called ctime()","width":529},{"text":"to actually give us a human readable version of the time","width":328},{"text":"both of these functions can be found inside the include time.h","width":306},{"text":"I've commented them up here","width":113},{"text":"so the first think we can do is call time so when you call time you can pass it a pointer to a time_t variable","width":717},{"text":"or you can say actuall I'm not going to give you anything and it will still give you back the time in its result","width":512},{"text":"so let's just use the result","width":145},{"text":"so here's the number of seconds since 1970","width":534},{"text":"we'll store that inside our little variable called secondsSince1970","width":359},{"text":"but I don't want that as a value, I just want to turn that into a string","width":224},{"text":"for that there's a function called ctime, this a library function. there are other functions that give greater control to the precise formatting","width":630},{"text":"but for this demo let's just use ctime() which has some reasonable formatting that most people can understand","width":617},{"text":"this will give us back a pointer to the time","width":319},{"text":"so the time in ASCII, in otherwords in letters, in readable time","width":484},{"text":"and then we can use that and copy that result into new memory, into our result","width":526},{"text":"so one problem with ctime() is that it uses static storage","width":339},{"text":"in other words it's great if you just want to call it once, and it will use it's static storage to give you back the time in a readable format","width":674},{"text":"but don't expect that to stay around because if you call ctime() again in the future it is going to overwrite those bytes","width":455},{"text":"and that's why our little function here called currenttime() is useful","width":200},{"text":"we are going to take that temporary result and put it into some memory that is ours to control","width":403},{"text":"so it can't be overwritten","width":174},{"text":"we need to pass in seconds since midnight","width":223},{"text":"except we've got a problem here","width":208},{"text":"it doesn't actually want the value, it wants a pointer to this variable, it wants to know where in memory this variable is","width":554},{"text":"for that I have to introduce some new syntax, which is the &","width":270},{"text":"when you see & it means that I don't want to know about the variable itself, but where it is stored in memory","width":523},{"text":"tell me the address of the variable","width":305},{"text":"we didn't need this for arrays because that's what the array name gives us automatically","width":224},{"text":"but for other items we can use the & to find out where it is stored in memory","width":500},{"text":"let's compile and run it","width":374},{"text":"and we find out that my little virtual machine thinks it's Jan 1 2014","width":389},{"text":"not very accurate, we should probably change it, but it did print out what it thinks the current time","width":487},{"text":"I promised you that I'd mention a few more mistakes that we can make with heap memory","width":479},{"text":"one mistake we can make is to double free the same pointer","width":423},{"text":"this can lead to all sorts of horrendous problems because when you tell the heap that you've freed with some memory it might actually use that memory for it's own book keeping","width":719},{"text":"so it knows that the particular block of memory is free","width":275},{"text":"if you free it again it can confuse the book keeping, the pointers that the heap is using itself","width":684},{"text":"once we've freed some memory, dont free it by accident a second time!","width":208},{"text":"another common mistake in C programs is to continue using memory after we've freed it","width":536},{"text":"we shouldn't consider that memory to be valid anymore","width":175},{"text":"perhaps it's going to be reused by some other part of the program that is about to call malloc()","width":458},{"text":"and certainly we shouldn't expect anything that we've previously stored in there to be valid","width":469},{"text":"once we've freed it don't try to use the pointer again","width":188},{"text":"so for example, this would be an error","width":217},{"text":"so how can we guard against some of these errors?","width":199},{"text":"one common defensive programming technique is once we free a pointer set that pointer to be NULL","width":498},{"text":"to mean that I'm not pointing to anything anymore","width":212},{"text":"so this avoids the problem of what is called a dangling pointer error","width":429},{"text":"that now our pointer is no longer pointing to invalid memory","width":541},{"text":"that's it for me. time for you

value","width":297},{"text":"in addition to the next pointer","width":129},{"text":"the pointer to the next link","width":106},{"text":"okay so let's make some methods to create links and destroy them","width":440},{"text":"we'll do the create one first","width":123},{"text":"so it's going to return a pointer to a link","width":227},{"text":"and i might call it say link_create and I'll expect a key and I'll expect a value","width":721},{"text":"so that'll give me two pointers","width":159},{"text":"if i wish to debug this I could have a printf in here saying hey creating link and I could have what the key and values are for example","width":737},{"text":"right so i need to get some memory","width":165},{"text":"let's get some memory from the heap because we want our link to last for a long time until we decide to destroy it","width":445},{"text":"so i'll say malloc give me some memory and how much well i better ask for how big is my memory structure link_t","width":545},{"text":"and i will cast that return type as a pointer to my link object","width":445},{"text":"why do i do that","width":63},{"text":"well i want to be able to reference the sub parts","width":170},{"text":"the components of my struct","width":119},{"text":"and i will call that say result and i need to initialize my pointer","width":481},{"text":"so now i've got that I can set the key to be a key and the value to be the value","width":499},{"text":"now when i do this i am copying the pointers i'm not creating new strings","width":444},{"text":"so in other words i've now got a pointer called key and it's looking at exactly the same string array as the parameter is","width":499},{"text":"i haven't made any new string arrays","width":203},{"text":"so let's remember that when i return this","width":214},{"text":"that those pointers better be valid for the lifetime of the link","width":288},{"text":"well that's fine if I knew for example that this will always be used with string constants or I am taking control of those values that I send in and I happen to know that their lifetime is longer than the link's lifetime","width":1068},{"text":"so if that's the case then my code is relatively simple like this","width":214},{"text":"and destroying the link is also relatively simple","width":225},{"text":"so let's write a link destroy method destroy","width":205},{"text":"which takes a pointer to the link that is going to disappear so we can call that just p","width":437},{"text":"and what do i need to do in here","width":104},{"text":"well i can simply return the memory back","width":190},{"text":"okay so this works we could do a little better than this","width":253},{"text":"we could actually do some defensive programming here","width":150},{"text":"where we also destroy the information inside that link","width":381},{"text":"so for that i can use memory set","width":190},{"text":"so memset where I give it a pointer that I want to use","width":325},{"text":"the value will be zero the number of bytes can be the size of my link","width":279},{"text":"so this assures that i don't have any dangling pointers","width":258},{"text":"i have destroyed the key and value pointers","width":232},{"text":"i've set them back to null and anything else inside my link has been set to null","width":247},{"text":"so if someone happens to have a pointer to this link and they try to use the contents straight away then it will fail it will be null","width":521},{"text":"and secondly we are freeing it to say okay this memory can now be reused for other purposes","width":356},{"text":"so that's my link destroy method","width":158},{"text":"now suppose we discover that our strings we don't control the lifetime of these string arrays","width":483},{"text":"and that actually we should make copies of them","width":186},{"text":"so how can i do that","width":89},{"text":"well there's a method called strdup so let's do that strdup and this gives me back a pointer to a new string ","width":697},{"text":"a new character array that has been created on the heap","width":223},{"text":"and it's just a copy of that existing character array that we passed it","width":296},{"text":"so let's create our new string arrays and use those","width":296},{"text":"if we do that then when I destroy the link I better free up the memory associated with my key and value","width":470},{"text":"so before ending here I should free up those pointers","width":344},{"text":"so I should call free on my key and free on my value pointer as well","width":641},{"text":"okay so there's my code now to start working with a link","width":780},{"text":"with my main method I will need to always know the beginning of my linked list","width":448},{"text":"so that sounds like a great thing to actually have as a global variable here","width":312},{"text":"so let me have my link pointer here and I can call it root","width":327},{"text":"and so the first link I make I can initialize root to that","width":316},{"text":"to that very first link","width":157},{"text":"okay so that's it for now, it's now time for you to play with creating more links","width":389},{"text":"bye","width":70}],

std.io","width":232},{"text":"i can say give me a single character for example and why don't I just keep calling this","width":400},{"text":"so i could just say while getchar is not equal to a special constant called end of file (EOF) keep going around in a loop","width":590},{"text":"but if I actually want to print them out I better actually store the value of getchar","width":232},{"text":"so let's have an integer value called c and inside my while condition I'm actually going to assign the result into c","width":544},{"text":"so you'll often see this pattern inside systems programming where we take a systems call or a library call and we store the results inside a variable","width":643},{"text":"but because that may also signify an error condition or a termination condition we use it immediately to check inside part of a while loop or an if statement","width":641},{"text":"so we've got a little character loop here that is going to keep going until it gets to the end of the file","width":254},{"text":"so now I want to print it out","width":92},{"text":"guess what i can call putchar and we'll see that running ","width":217},{"text":"so let's run this little program","width":264},{"text":"ABCD","width":90},{"text":"it prints back ABCD","width":147},{"text":"okay so we don't have to display the character just as a character","width":273},{"text":"we can display it as a character an integer and hexdecimal values","width":255},{"text":"so let's use printf for that","width":94},{"text":"so I've got %c %d and %x for character integer and hexadecimal value","width":376},{"text":"alright so let's run this","width":324},{"text":"and you can see that the letter A corresponds to sixty five which is in hexadecimal forty one","width":385},{"text":"right so why don't we use our little program to print out the contents of another file","width":433},{"text":"so if I cat my source code I can see the contents of that","width":292},{"text":"great so I'm going to pipe it into my program","width":273},{"text":"so i'll do ./program and it reads every byte and prints it out as a character","width":526},{"text":"great so let's encrypt our file now so I'm going to modify our value of c if it's not a newline character","width":533},{"text":"so what we'll do is say if c is at least thirty two in other words at least a space an ascii space","width":470},{"text":"and if it is we will change the lowest bit","width":382},{"text":"we'll flip the lowest bit","width":61},{"text":"how can we do that","width":64},{"text":"let's xor it with one","width":169},{"text":"right and then we'll print it out","width":147},{"text":"okay so we'll run this","width":172},{"text":"CDE for example and it changed the C to a B","width":281},{"text":"and if I do 135 I get 024","width":254},{"text":"so to say that I've got to the end of the file when I'm just typing you by the way you can do control d","width":374},{"text":"now see this working on some actual source code","width":226},{"text":"so let's here some text my program.c and i'm going to pipe that into my program to use as its input","width":524},{"text":"and you can see great we've garbled the program","width":264},{"text":"so if I want to I can then take that output and pipe it into my program again","width":444},{"text":"so now i'm going to unencrypt it because i flipped the lowest bit back  ","width":259},{"text":"so we get back our source code","width":133},{"text":"so that's getchar and putchar i can also work with whole lines","width":372},{"text":"i can let's get rid of the loop here i can say puts hello or any pointer to a character array provided its terminated by a zero byte at the end","width":997},{"text":"and that is equivalent to printf by saying %s and \\n at the end","width":560},{"text":"so i've got some character pointer here","width":279},{"text":"right so it's a little bit shorter to type than writing printf","width":480},{"text":"there is the opposite which is to get some input","width":225},{"text":"but this has a problem and we'll see why in a moment why this function actually call is being removed from the c standard","width":392},{"text":"i'm talking about gets so let's call gets and we will have a little buffer here","width":648},{"text":"so let's put a little buffer on the stack here","width":187},{"text":"i'll make it twelve bytes today ","width":109},{"text":"and remember when we call gets with buffer if you use the array name you are talking about the very first byte of the array","width":432},{"text":"and rather than printing out hello","width":175},{"text":"we will print out our buffer value","width":137},{"text":"so let's run this and we can type something in and it echos it back to us","width":509},{"text":"fantastic but what happens if we enter more than twelve bytes","width":262},{"text":"so in other words could something bad happen to our other variables","width":247},{"text":"well yes it could because if we go past twelve bytes we start writing into memory which is used for other purposes","width":353},{"text":"for example in my little program the integer is immediately after the buffer","width":378},{"text":"let's prove this let's set our hex value of c to be ten twenty thirty fourty","width":422},{"text":"let me print that out after we've called gets i'm going to print it again","width":584},{"text":"so we've got to remember that what we store is going to be our letters plus a null byte","width":475},{"text":"so in this case if I do ABCDABCDABCD I've already overflowed because the thirteenth byte is now going to be written into my integer","width":796},{"text":"but i am going to do just a few more I'll do ABCD there we go","width":295},{"text":"and we'll see that I've managed to change my integer value to 41424344","width":412},{"text":"so the last ABC that I wrote in there actually overran my buffer","width":277},{"text":"i've got a buffer overflow and I've corrupted the contents of another variable","width":300},{"text":"so that's why gets is dangerous","width":107},{"text":"there's no way to tell gets that we shouldn't accept input that is too long for it","width":420},{"text":"so in a future video i'll tell you about getline and also fgets which don't suffer from these problems","width":586},{"text":"okay that's it for me thanks for watching and i'll see you in another video. bye!","width":269}],

  [{"text":"Hello! Let's talk about how we can use scanf and sscanf and fscanf to read some data and convert that into say integers or floats or strings","width":739},{"text":"so we can actually use those values inside our variables","width":232},{"text":"alright, so, I'll start by using sscanf","width":207},{"text":"which can parse data inside a string","width":184},{"text":"inside memory","width":109},{"text":"so for example, let's have a little bit of data here","width":136},{"text":"I'll have my data be my name and a score","width":454},{"text":"and I want to take that and pull it apart into a string and an integer","width":385},{"text":"so I'll have a little buffer here, say, up to twenty characters","width":343},{"text":"and a little integer here","width":102},{"text":"and I could set this to be equal to some arbitrary value. we'll see why in a little bit","width":434},{"text":"and then I'm going to say \"okay, sscanf please read from this string array and what I'd like you to do is convert that into a string followed by one or more spaces and then an integer value\"","width":1146},{"text":"alright so scanf is going to look at our memory starting at wherever our data is pointing at","width":359},{"text":"and, it's going to first of all look for a string until it comes across one space","width":357},{"text":"and then there can be actually multiple spaces in our data","width":155},{"text":"and then after that, it's going to treat the rest of the string as an integer","width":287},{"text":"okay, now, our format specifiers say the kind of data that we want to interpret and also the number of bytes that should be written to when it is trying to parse its data","width":730},{"text":"so we better tell it where to exactly put these things","width":154},{"text":"so for our string, we want it to write it into a buffer","width":234},{"text":"and for the score, we want to write it into our score variable","width":199},{"text":"but hold on a moment","width":114},{"text":"when we say \"buffer\" yes that gives us the beginning address of our array","width":372},{"text":"but not for score","width":63},{"text":"score is just going to give us whatever value score happens to hold","width":170},{"text":"in this case, negative forty two","width":124},{"text":"that's not what we need","width":69},{"text":"we actually want the address of this variable","width":132},{"text":"so we're going to say ampersand score","width":239},{"text":"so, lets read that and we'll print it out","width":271},{"text":"so here's the result and we'll say %s %d and we'll print the contents of the buffer and print the value of score","width":592},{"text":"so notice that scanf and printf, the arguments don't always look the same","width":266},{"text":"when we want to print out the values, we don't actually want to just print out the address of score","width":389},{"text":"we actually wanted to know what the value is","width":106},{"text":"great so that read that correctly","width":202},{"text":"scanf actually tells us something else which is how many arguments it correctly managed to parse","width":428},{"text":"so let's make a note of that and we'll print that out","width":299},{"text":"so, we'll say %d here","width":313},{"text":"print out the result in our printf statement here","width":183},{"text":"so now when we run it, we'll see that sscanf managed to read both iterms","width":384},{"text":"I got result two","width":90},{"text":"fantastic. so that's useful. now we can write robust programs to check if we really did write into both variables","width":521},{"text":"now you might be worried that scanf could result in a buffer overflow","width":286},{"text":"and, in fact, in our current code, you'd be right","width":168},{"text":"so if I had a very long name with no spaces here","width":419},{"text":"then that's longer than our buffer","width":229},{"text":"so what we need to do is tell scanf just how big our buffer is","width":209},{"text":"so in this case, it should be nineteen","width":207},{"text":"because we're setting scanf how many character to read from the input","width":321},{"text":"and our buffer, of course, if going to need one extra one to hold the terminating byte for this string","width":397},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":483},{"text":"and you'll see that first of all the name is truncated and that secondly, the return value of our scanf call here was one","width":538},{"text":"and it only managed to read into the buffer","width":259},{"text":"it gave up trying to read the integer because our buffer wasn't long enough","width":190},{"text":"and, in fact, our score variable still contained its original value","width":305},{"text":"of negative forty two","width":123},{"text":"so good defensive programs must check that the return value is reasonable","width":389},{"text":"also, when writing scanf or sscanf or fscanf, it's always a good idea to carefully check to see whether you should be looking at the address of the variable or if the variable itself actually is a pointer","width":783},{"text":"and is already going to give you the memory address that you'd like scanf to change","width":532},{"text":"alright so we've read data from a string ","width":263},{"text":"we can also parse data from a file stream and how can we do that? well you can use not sscanf but fscanf","width":663},{"text":"and if you did that, you better give it a file stream","width":182},{"text":"there's one called stdin already","width":209},{"text":"if we didn't want to use that, then we could open up a file using fopen and then pass in the file handle here","width":564},{"text":"and reading from stdin is such a common occurance that in fact there's another form of this which is just say scanf","width":699},{"text":"and if you do that, that means \"hey, just read from stdin\"","width":188},{"text":"so now, let's run our program here","width":555},{"text":"and, now it's waiting for input","width":99},{"text":"so let me typing something","width":130},{"text":"I'll say \"Angrave one hundred\"","width":324},{"text":"great! and it managed to parse both variables","width":177},{"text":"okay so that's enough introduction to scanf","width":188},{"text":"remember this next time you're trying to read 3d data and points and you want to say convert those ASCII numbers into actual floats and doubles","width":640},{"text":"and also remember that its important to read exactly how scanf uses these format specifiers because its not quite the same as printf","width":624},{"text":"alright, that's it for me. time for you to play. bye for now","width":278}],

  [{"text":"hello welcome","width":111},{"text":"let's talk about getline","width":93},{"text":"so it's very very common to read in a single line of text either from the user or from a file","width":438},{"text":"and we would like it to be very easy to say hey \"let's not worry about making sure my buffer is large enough\"","width":384},{"text":"I just want to get the whole line","width":95},{"text":"and thus getline was born","width":130},{"text":"this is being adopted into the posix standard","width":215},{"text":"if you are working however with older standard and an older compiler we have to ask gcc to explicitly enable it","width":463},{"text":"so before doing our includes with stdio we need to define _GNU_SOURCE","width":575},{"text":"so if we do that we would like the gnu source additions to the standard functions","width":473},{"text":"right so if we do that now we have got a getline declaration included as part of the #include <stdio.h>","width":478},{"text":"so here is how we can use getline","width":228},{"text":"with getline we actually set up two variables","width":284},{"text":"we get getline to manipulate these directly ","width":287},{"text":"we are going to have a pointer to a buffer","width":319},{"text":"and a little int to say how big is our buffer","width":369},{"text":"well let's just check to see really if it is an int or if we should be doing a different type","width":226},{"text":"so let me pull up my favorite manpage on getline","width":362},{"text":"see that actually the correct type to use is size_t","width":398},{"text":"which is essentially an unsigned int or larger on some systems","width":259},{"text":"so let's just make a note of that","width":99},{"text":"that is the declaration that we are going to be using","width":210},{"text":"and so we will have not just a buffer to our character array","width":377},{"text":"but also size as well to say how big is our buffer","width":328},{"text":"and i will call this say capacity","width":168},{"text":"right so we could start calling this and we could say okay","width":256},{"text":"get me a line and oh i need to pass in a pointer to my buffer variable","width":441},{"text":"right and notice that the declaration here is star star asteric so it's a pointer to a pointer","width":513},{"text":"right so how did i get that","width":97},{"text":"i say okay give me the address of my variable","width":223},{"text":"and similarly for the capacity as well","width":150},{"text":"the size of the variable","width":126},{"text":"so give me the address of my capacity","width":317},{"text":"and getline is going to modify those two variables directly","width":222},{"text":"essentially if my buffer is not large enough","width":189},{"text":"it is going to free up the old buffer and then call malloc so that we get a larger buffer","width":518},{"text":"okay technically it might call realloc but let's not worry about exactly which library call it calls","width":335},{"text":"we just know that it's going to do all that buffer maintenance for us automatically","width":266},{"text":"and now we need to give it a filestream so why don't we use say stdin","width":413},{"text":"now right now our code suffers from a terrible flaw which is that we've assumed that our automatic variables buffer capacity will be set to nothing","width":546},{"text":"so the getline knows that it can't reuse what it happens to be pointing to","width":264},{"text":"so we actually need to set these to explicitly to null and the capacity to zero","width":403},{"text":"so the first time we call getline getline will see that the buffer is certainly not large enough and will allocate enough space","width":502},{"text":"we can now find out what the result is which is the number of characters getline has managed to retrieve","width":519},{"text":"or a negative value if it failed","width":127},{"text":"so let's make a note of that","width":146},{"text":"and we'll print this out","width":125},{"text":"so i'll print it out as an integer and let's have a look to see what we can find inside our buffer","width":445},{"text":"so we want the result and we want the buffer","width":227},{"text":"and lastly let's put a newline here","width":169},{"text":"okay so we'll run our little program here","width":385},{"text":"and now it's waiting for me to type something","width":368},{"text":"okay great so it says i have got six characters","width":218},{"text":"wait and i printed ABCDE","width":102},{"text":"actually the last character might be a newline character","width":355},{"text":"and quite often we don't actually need that","width":152},{"text":"so why don't we overwrite the very last character with null with a terminating byte","width":439},{"text":"so let's write the code for that","width":160},{"text":"first of all we only want to do that if we get at least one character back from getline","width":289},{"text":"so let's check that the result was positive","width":300},{"text":"and also we only want to do this if we are going to overwrite the last character which truly is a newline","width":385},{"text":"we could imagine for example reading from a file where the very last byte is not actually a newline","width":363},{"text":"so we should just check to see what we're going to write here","width":233},{"text":"so let's look inside our buffer and where do we want to look?","width":275},{"text":"well if we read one character that would be at the beginning of the buffer","width":403},{"text":"so we need to look at result minus one","width":129},{"text":"so if that is equal to the character of a newline","width":352},{"text":"then let's truncate the string","width":262},{"text":"the easiest way to do that remember is strings are just terminated by zero","width":190},{"text":"so let's just put a zero directly into that byte","width":188},{"text":"so we are going to say at the same spot set that equal to zero","width":356},{"text":"right so let's run our program again","width":534},{"text":"okay so this time it read it correctly and in our printf we didn't get that unwanted extra newline","width":570},{"text":"alright our program right now is allocating memory on the heap","width":270},{"text":"we don't do it we let getline do it","width":127},{"text":"but it's actually up to us when we finish using getline to free that buffer","width":362},{"text":"right so let's do that","width":121},{"text":"let's at the very end here we can call free on the buffer","width":316},{"text":"we don't need to do that every time we call getline because getline by default will try to for performance try to reuse the buffer for each line it gets","width":576},{"text":"so for example we could call getline twice and it would try to use the same buffer","width":511},{"text":"but the big take home message for getline is first of all","width":186},{"text":"you are going to need a pointer to a buffer and a capacity variacle which getline itself is going to change the contents of","width":470},{"text":"as you call it it can make the buffer as large as","width":304},{"text":"each time you call getline it might change that buffer to point to some new memory if the buffer needs to be larger","width":439},{"text":"secondly it's a great idea to check the return value of getline to see how many characters it managed to read","width":469},{"text":"and also to see if there was an error or not","width":138},{"text":"and the return type for that is ssize_t for a signed size integer type","width":469},{"text":"and finally it's good practice to don't forget to free the memory that is pointed at by your buffer variable","width":546},{"text":"okay that's it for me","width":87},{"text":"have fun playing bye","width":78}],

  [{"text":"Hello welcome","width":135},{"text":"so this video is a little introduction to signals","width":222},{"text":"so signals are like a software interrupt","width":198},{"text":"we can use them to control our processes and even do things asynchronously","width":322},{"text":"so let's have a look at a little program i have written so far that doesn't use signals yet","width":333},{"text":"all it does is ask for the environment of home","width":181},{"text":"in other words the user's home directory","width":172},{"text":"and then we have a little loop that prints it out and sleeps for three seconds","width":314},{"text":"so every three seconds it is going to print out my home directory","width":211},{"text":"and on this machine i am root so it just keeps on printing out slash root","width":387},{"text":"so of course we can stop this program by pressing control c","width":383},{"text":"and when you do that you actually are sending a signal","width":195},{"text":"sigint or sig interrupt to the process","width":261},{"text":"now it maybe that our process doesn't like being interrupted","width":198},{"text":"why don't we catch that signal and install our own little handle for that","width":319},{"text":"so here is how we will do this","width":158},{"text":"i am going to say at the beginning of my program that if you get a certain signal say sigint ","width":797},{"text":"rather than having the default behavior which as we know is to stop the program or quit the program","width":367},{"text":"let us run my code instead","width":113},{"text":"so i will call it say nothankyou","width":227},{"text":"so what is nothankyou","width":113},{"text":"it has to be a pointer to a function","width":252},{"text":"how do we do that","width":61},{"text":"easy just write a function","width":75},{"text":"and in this case the correct type is something that doesn't return anything","width":310},{"text":"but does take an integer","width":136},{"text":"in fact it is the signal that is being sent to our program","width":253},{"text":"and so that we know that this is being called let's write something out directly to standard output","width":342},{"text":"so i can say write and i can say no","width":219},{"text":"so what is that that is a little message of three bytes to send","width":228},{"text":"so let's run this now","width":155},{"text":"okay so here is my program every three seconds it is going to print root","width":248},{"text":"but now i am going to press control c","width":359},{"text":"and it prints no no so it's refusing to quit","width":405},{"text":"you might also notice that the sleep also immediately returns","width":242},{"text":"more about that later","width":99},{"text":"it is still possible to stop our program here","width":180},{"text":"if we do control backslash then we force it to quit","width":382},{"text":"so sigint is one common signal that we send our programs","width":259},{"text":"there are many others","width":92},{"text":"just for fun let me show you one called sigalarm","width":239},{"text":"so this time i am going to say alarm seven seconds","width":498},{"text":"and so when you call alarm you are going to say give me a special signal called sigalrm in this many seconds","width":626},{"text":"in seven seconds","width":82},{"text":"and we better install then","width":112},{"text":"well let's just run it and see what happens to begin with","width":795},{"text":"so the default behavior of this sigalrm is to actually stop our program","width":299},{"text":"it quits the program","width":103},{"text":"that's a pretty aggressive alarm clock i think you'll agree","width":175},{"text":"and it also as you see prints out alarm clock on the shell","width":233},{"text":"perhaps we don't want our alarm signal to be so menacing","width":308},{"text":"so this time instead of sigint i can say look for a certain signal called sigalrm","width":452},{"text":"please call my function instead","width":515},{"text":"okay so there we go our alarm went off after four seconds and this time we asynchronously ran our code that printed out no to standard out","width":704},{"text":"so this is pretty exciting right","width":98},{"text":"you probably thought about interrupts on the hardware level","width":228},{"text":"now we can do interrupts at the software level and we can respond to things which happen in our environment very quickly","width":459},{"text":"so we will find signals to be very useful when we start dealing working with more than one process","width":381},{"text":"we can control our programs and we can also work with very large amounts of data coming in","width":371},{"text":"alright that is enough for me","width":106},{"text":"bye","width":36}],

  [{"text":"so usually we think about our programs as just turning into one single process","width":299},{"text":"now i am going to show you some systems programming magic","width":187},{"text":"where actually we can turn our single process into two","width":217},{"text":"here is how we are going to do it","width":105},{"text":"let us have a very simple program that says hello world","width":216},{"text":"and here it is","width":138},{"text":"so between these two lines however","width":198},{"text":"i am going to call fork","width":426},{"text":"and here's a surprise","width":91},{"text":"we get hello world world","width":90},{"text":"yes we get two worlds","width":129},{"text":"why is that","width":65},{"text":"well at the beginning there was a single process","width":117},{"text":"but then we called fork and now our single process is actually being cloned","width":340},{"text":"it has been split into two","width":111},{"text":"so both the processes print out world","width":164},{"text":"and so we see both their output on our little terminal here","width":297},{"text":"okay what else can we do with this","width":97},{"text":"well let us first of all show that there really are two different processes","width":192},{"text":"i am going to look at their processor id","width":351},{"text":"and we will print it out","width":168},{"text":"so i will call getpid()","width":102},{"text":"and you will see that yeah i have got two different processes","width":258},{"text":"both trying to run at the same time","width":191},{"text":"in fact i have got a parent child relationship here","width":289},{"text":"i have got the original process","width":128},{"text":"the parent","width":63},{"text":"and you can think of fork as saying let us clone this original process right here right now","width":375},{"text":"so that i get a child that looks just like me","width":153},{"text":"or at least almost like me","width":111},{"text":"in many many respects","width":63},{"text":"it is the same memory","width":152},{"text":"it has got it's own variables","width":63},{"text":"but because its got its own address space","width":251},{"text":"what the child now does in terms of its memory is seperate from the parents","width":369},{"text":"okay so let's show you what we can then do with this","width":330},{"text":"first of all fork actually returns something here","width":154},{"text":"it actually returns back an id","width":192},{"text":"so let's make a note of that","width":188},{"text":"and we'll print it out","width":124},{"text":"so we'll say %d and we'll print out just here","width":552},{"text":"okay so here is what we see","width":166},{"text":"that the process id 681 has fork value of 682","width":562},{"text":"and process 682 has a fork return value of 0","width":386},{"text":"so the fork value is different for the parent and the child","width":290},{"text":"and in fact fork","width":173},{"text":"if it returns a positive number is talking to the parent","width":238},{"text":"and is telling the parent here is the id number for your child","width":333},{"text":"so let us make a note of that","width":162},{"text":"let us call this","width":75},{"text":"here is my child","width":63},{"text":"so i can call my child","width":149},{"text":"and then i can write an if statement to decide if i am the parent or the newly created child or not","width":466},{"text":"so we will say look if the child id what i return from fork is actually greater than 0","width":470},{"text":"then i am the parent","width":194},{"text":"so let's put something like hey i'm the grouchy parent","width":575},{"text":"if it is zero however then hey I'm the carefree child!","width":905},{"text":"so we will let's remove this ","width":254},{"text":"i'll get rid of that line now","width":83},{"text":"okay so now we have a little program where the parent and child are going to do two different things","width":381},{"text":"and in fact it is standard for the parent to wait for the child to finish","width":438},{"text":"we don't have to but quite often we need the child process to do something for us","width":436},{"text":"perhaps in the background","width":112},{"text":"but we don't actually want to continue until the child has finished","width":234},{"text":"so let us do that","width":88},{"text":"what i am going to wait for my child to finish","width":262},{"text":"so i am going to say waitpid and i need to say okay what is the id i need to wait on well here is the childid","width":566},{"text":"and later on i can ask for some status information about my child","width":345},{"text":"and for now the last argument i am just going to put as 0","width":189},{"text":"so i need to have a variable called status just a little integer","width":299},{"text":"and in fact we are going to pass not just the value of status but the address of our little variable","width":400},{"text":"and later on we can use that to find out say did our child exit normally or was it terminated in a surprising way","width":492},{"text":"so let us run this now and what we will expect to see is that we'll wait for the child to finish before we print","width":519},{"text":"I'm the grouchy parent","width":63},{"text":"so let's run this","width":393},{"text":"okay so this time the child process got to print out I'm the carefree child","width":442},{"text":"then it exited","width":119},{"text":"meanwhile the parent was waiting for the async condition and when that happened","width":342},{"text":"the parent is able to continue and is able to print I'm the grouchy parent","width":416},{"text":"so i want to finish on a common programming error that can really bring down a server","width":564},{"text":"and that is suppose we made many many many processes","width":406},{"text":"so it is one thing to create a few","width":142},{"text":"let's call say fork a couple of times and perhaps you can guess how many worlds we'll see here","width":971},{"text":"that's right we see four worlds","width":146},{"text":"and in fact the parent finished early so this is the hash of the terminal saying what would you like to do now","width":540},{"text":"but we had four processes all printing out world","width":212},{"text":"and if we had three forks now we have eight","width":311},{"text":"okay so let us make something now called a fork bomb which is where we keep creating lots and lots of processes","width":550},{"text":"and this often happens by accident by people who are new to systems programming","width":326},{"text":"but just for fun because i am just doing this inside a browser it doesn't matter if i bring my little virtual machine to a halt","width":582},{"text":"i can always just reload the page","width":114},{"text":"so let's print out my id","width":630},{"text":"i will put this in a little loop that says while one let's fork","width":327},{"text":"let's print out my process id","width":347},{"text":"and then i will sleep two seconds","width":460},{"text":"so initially i have two processes","width":111},{"text":"and then each of those processes calls fork","width":209},{"text":"so we got four","width":51},{"text":"and then each of those processes call fork","width":171},{"text":"prints it out and sleeps","width":93},{"text":"and so every two seconds i am doubling the number of processes that are in my system","width":291},{"text":"so that's a lot of processes","width":124},{"text":"and in fact pretty soon the kernel will run out of space","width":324},{"text":"it won't be able to keep track of any more processes","width":138},{"text":"and fork will stop working","width":220},{"text":"and now we see here's the kernel printing out all sorts of debug messages","width":248},{"text":"desperately trying to make the system stable again","width":190},{"text":"as it arbitrarily starts to kill processes in an attempt to recover some memory and space in its process tables","width":539},{"text":"so amazingly my little kernel here has managed to recover to the point to where i have a working system","width":500},{"text":"but that is fork bombs and you should avoid from accidentally doing this","width":346},{"text":"otherwise you will have a system administrator telling you that you cannot log onto that machine anymore","width":286},{"text":"okay have fun and i'll see you in the next video","width":194},{"text":"bye","width":39}],

  [{"text":"okay, good morning class, how are you","width":367},{"text":"I'm good thank you","width":103},{"text":"alright, for those of you that weren't paying attention, cs241 has started. good morning class, how are you?!","width":373},{"text":"alright, great. so, in the next 15 minutes the game of course is for you to leave this room with more passion for system programming and maybe some more knowledge about how to do it as well","width":668},{"text":"and maybe some knowledge about how not to do it as well","width":210},{"text":"so one of the intents here is cover gotchas and common programming mistakes","width":280},{"text":"so, if you have a burning question, there's probably someone else in this room that has the same question","width":321},{"text":"I will endeavor to answer as many questions as possible without derailing the lecture","width":238},{"text":"so feel free to speak up","width":135},{"text":"if it's not appropriate, I will tell you","width":115},{"text":"and, just stay, come down and talk to me afterwards","width":147},{"text":"also, I hold office hours usually three times a week immediately after lecture","width":265},{"text":"because I figured thats the best way to reach most of the students","width":238},{"text":"so feel free to stop me","width":150},{"text":"I may not be able to stay for a full hour every time","width":157},{"text":"for example, there's a faculty meeting today where we're talking about how to take over the world","width":276},{"text":"uiuc style","width":83},{"text":"but most times I'm there to help you","width":286},{"text":"and I love to see people progress. its fantastic stuff when you start from the beginning of this course when you don't know anything","width":397},{"text":"till the end where you can actually do some pretty cool things","width":187},{"text":"and by the way, last semester many students came to me to say \"hey! you know what? I just had an interview and they asked me to explain X\" where X is a cs241 thing","width":657},{"text":"such as, what's the difference between a process and a thread?","width":223},{"text":"whats the difference between stack memory and heap memory?","width":136},{"text":"how would you do that?","width":55},{"text":"what's a common gotcha with this?","width":104},{"text":"why would a C program crash? that kinda stuff","width":265},{"text":"so you might find that the knowledge you gain in this class actually has an immediate impact for you outside of this class","width":413},{"text":"and if it does, wonderful!","width":160},{"text":"alright, so, let's get started with a couple of trick questions","width":333},{"text":"that we have here, wanna go to overhead, right!","width":292},{"text":"okay! how do you look up information for C library calls and system calls?","width":228},{"text":"easy! okay, here's the beautiful thing. with POSIX, POSIX includes many things","width":605},{"text":"it includes an API (application programming interface) in other ways, instead of calls, you can call","width":392},{"text":"and also, a manual of man pages about those calls","width":374},{"text":"so guess what? we're actually going to look up different calls","width":227},{"text":"the art of course is knowing which calls you should use","width":329},{"text":"and the POSIX man pages aren't going to tell you that","width":202},{"text":"you already have to have a basic idea of \"oh yeah! I need to use open\" or \"or yes! I need to use write or stat or lstat or fork()\"","width":629},{"text":"so that's the main thing you're going to get out of this course is the vocabulary","width":264},{"text":"with the then end expectation that you would actually then start to use this stuff and look it up","width":320},{"text":"so we've got two different kinds of things. we've got C library calls and system calls","width":463},{"text":"the C library is the part of your process","width":188},{"text":"okay, what's the difference between a program and a process?","width":153},{"text":"well, the program is the code that you've written turned into bytes which say you stored on disk","width":339},{"text":"and then when you actually execute it, or actually run it, it becomes a process","width":274},{"text":"and of course you can have multiple processes running for the same piece of program code","width":310},{"text":"but part of that process is the C library","width":146},{"text":"it comes kind of bundled with or loaded at runtime and it's a set of code and maybe some constants too that just runs as part of it","width":524},{"text":"so what kind of C library calls do we have? well for example, perhaps you want to do a string copy where you want to say \"okay, copy all the bytes into a destination from a source\"","width":787},{"text":"and we're gonna pass two pointers and it will keep copying those bytes starting from source into destination until what?","width":666},{"text":"until it reaches a zero byte","width":156},{"text":"because that's the definition of a C string","width":192},{"text":"of course, bad things might happen if you accidentally put these in the wrong order","width":312},{"text":"alright, if you tried to copy from some arbitrary place into a different place, who knows how many bytes its gonna copy before it gets to zero? oops.","width":512},{"text":"who knows where its going to immediately crash your program?","width":171},{"text":"for example, it might be that you try to write into some read only memory","width":306},{"text":"and the hardware say \"ah ah excuse me? excuse me? you see that process over there? it's being a baaad baaaaad process\"","width":483},{"text":"ok lady gaga I might","width":107},{"text":"so, look I enjoyed that joke personally","width":296},{"text":"so, let's um, this is an example of a C library call. it doesn't need to go into the system to run this","width":635},{"text":"we can do this entirely inside the process space","width":218},{"text":"inside the virtual memory of our proces","width":226},{"text":"ok, what about system calls? well, here's an example of one, you've already seen it: \"write()\"","width":412},{"text":"we want to get outside of our system. we want to break out of our system and get the system to break outside of our process and do something","width":444},{"text":"to the rest of the world","width":123},{"text":"okay, so, the system itself needs to handle that particular call","width":361},{"text":"and in fact it does that using a hardware interrupt","width":262},{"text":"that's the red pill, if you follow the matrix movie","width":218},{"text":"that's how you escape out of the box. out of the sandbox that your poor little process is stuck inside","width":508},{"text":"anyway, so we want to look up say some information about these and so for that we can use \"man\"","width":420},{"text":"which reads man pages","width":154},{"text":"which are incredibly terse and utterly useless if you dont have some basic knowledge","width":322},{"text":"but pretty useful if you already know something about what you intend to do","width":369},{"text":"so let's try one","width":276},{"text":"box pc","width":392},{"text":"okay so let's try looking up for example \"printf()\"","width":317},{"text":"there it is","width":44},{"text":"and it's in section 3 of the man page","width":96},{"text":"okay yeah, we want to open it. there it is","width":125},{"text":"now what do we see about these man pages? well the things I want to show you is that first of all it tells you what includes you better have","width":448},{"text":"it also includes a whole load of function calls which do similar things","width":300},{"text":"so, as well as printf, we've got sprintf or snprintf","width":367},{"text":"and, then we've got some really terse information on what it's gonna do","width":286},{"text":"and usually its got a return value as well","width":299},{"text":"so they might return say the number of characters printed","width":316},{"text":"excluding the NULL byte used to end output strings","width":192},{"text":"notice how those display little parenthesis here as if its not that important","width":325},{"text":"as if the number of bytes written is not that important to you","width":189},{"text":"as if that could never cause a big program to fail","width":239},{"text":"accidentally, you might assume that that is the actual number of bytes written","width":218},{"text":"no no no, it excludes it and it's an off by one error","width":172},{"text":"it's actually going to ignore the fact that it may have written a zero at the end because it's the end of a C string","width":394},{"text":"oops! that's exciting.","width":107},{"text":"you may have not had enough memory. you may have overwritten something else","width":306},{"text":"so, when you read man pages, read them slowly and try to understand everything they say","width":443},{"text":"and of course, it's always useful to find an example","width":266},{"text":"oh, this one actually has one, look at that! amazing","width":194},{"text":"most of them don't bother with an example","width":101},{"text":"so you end up doing any google search to say \"okay, easy example of blah blah blah blah\"","width":339},{"text":"but yeah so they're a good reference material","width":220},{"text":"now you'll notice we had different sections","width":137}],

  [{"text":"Let's do another one","width":182},{"text":"Let's look for fork - create a child process. Yes, that's right, you create children by forking","width":922},{"text":"I knew you'd remember something from this lecture. We'll play more with this later because it's an amazing thing you can do with posix. You're first process can actually clone itself, at that very moment to become two separate processes","width":1221},{"text":"It's like you pull a switch and suddenly you've got a doppelganger","width":347},{"text":"If you're a physicist and you think about the many worlds theorem, it's a bit like that. The world from a process point of view splits into two. Suddenly you've got two processes for the price of one","width":681},{"text":"OK, so we'll see that. But again, notice we had different sections","width":265},{"text":"The sections you're going to see are.... can you see this? let's see if we can make it bigger","width":721},{"text":"section two, alright. This is where all the system calls live","width":368},{"text":"section three, this is where you'll find the C library stuff","width":275},{"text":"and section seven, you'll occasionally find there's actually longer articles. I hesitate to call them tutorials, they're not that useful","width":668},{"text":"but more long winded articles that have some better practices. it's worth reading at some point during this course","width":472},{"text":"you might find some useful information there. for example, when we talk about signals, but most of the time you'll be using these as reference","width":496},{"text":"unfortunately, let's go back to here and look up stat. some words appear in multiple places and if I make a new window here","width":970},{"text":"and I do man stat, then I get the wrong one. I get the one that would happen from the shell. So i have to say 'no, no, no I really wanted section two'","width":942},{"text":"so sometimes you have to force it to find the right section","width":411},{"text":"that's enough about man pages. you will be using them. when it comes to quizzes, i'll talk more about that later, but i will have expected you to know something basic about the return values, some of the common gotchas of using different calls","width":1074},{"text":"do you remember how to allocate memory on the heap?","width":398},{"text":"if your neighbor said 'malloc' congratulations, you made a good seating choice","width":356},{"text":"yes, malloc is one way to say 'hey, I need some memory and it's mine until I what?'","width":855},{"text":"free it, yes! ","width":216},{"text":"when you call malloc you are going to point to some bytes. will those bytes be zero?","width":788},{"text":"do you feel lucky punk? the answer is maybe, but it's not guaranteed. ","width":411},{"text":"if you get a brand new, fresh page of memory from the OS it's likely to have been zeroed out by the OS to make sure you don't accidently get any information from another process","width":831},{"text":"remember, we're trying to keep our processes separate, so you can't accidentally read someone else's password, or secret key, or something else that's secretly happening inside another process","width":550},{"text":"the OS makes sure to usually give you some zeroed memory","width":315},{"text":"however, if it's reuse of your own memory, it's quite likely there's just garbage in there","width":493},{"text":"it could be that because it's zero it lulls you into a false sense of security, you assume memory is zero","width":607},{"text":"why did C do this? sounds like a terrible thing to put the onus on programmers to make sure their programs always work. why didn't they always zero out the memory?","width":941},{"text":"time consuming, yes! C is all about trying to be as efficient as possible and if you can't cope with that, get a different major","width":725},{"text":"That is C's attitude, maybe we can find tools to spot memory errors, but it's very much a case of we're trying to write a language which is just a little bit above assembler. it's meant to be that it's almost as efficient as assembly code, just a lot easier to read and write","width":1409},{"text":"malloc has to be very efficient because we use it a lot. think about your java programs, OK I'm sorry. I know that was a bad experience, but think about all the times you've made new objects, etc.","width":832},{"text":"underneath that we're saying 'OK, I need some more memory'","width":276},{"text":"so malloc's job is to find some bytes. you say 'oh quick, I need another thirty two bytes and I need it right now. I can't continue my process untiil you give me thirty two bytes fo rme to play with. And, yes, I promise to free it later when I'm finished with it.'","width":960},{"text":"some processes are allocating a lot of memory all the time. so malloc tries to be efficient and when you free some memory, we can put it back into this pool of bytes that we can use later again. That's why it's called a heap, it's just going to be a big disorganized mess of allocated space and unallocated space","width":1346},{"text":"And, in fact, it's tricky to write malloc and free, so we are going to ask you to do it in 241","width":491},{"text":"we've got malloc and free. later on you'll also see halloc and realloc, but let's not talk about those now","width":580},{"text":"you can just implement those on top of malloc","width":389},{"text":"suppose we wanted to write our own string copy function. here it is!","width":562},{"text":"because these are character pointers, I should mention, how big is a character in C? ","width":638},{"text":"the size of a single [byte]","width":221},{"text":"if I do sizeof character,the answer is one. everywhere, at all times, before I even compile the code. it's a definition that the size of a character type is one","width":1079},{"text":"sizeof gives you the number of bytes","width":416},{"text":"so a character is always one byte. If i put a variable name in there I'd get one","width":618},{"text":"when I add one to these pointers, it is going to be incrementing along one byte at a time. I read one byte and I add one to the source pointer and add one to the destination pointer","width":902},{"text":"this code is slightly broken. perhaps you and your neighbor can figure out how it should be fixed. i'll point out the following","width":742},{"text":"what does this do? while star source","width":363},{"text":"thank you, yes! remember star means dereference, follow the money, take this expression and use it as a memory pointer and actually tell me what's in there","width":649},{"text":"because we're talking about a character pointer, we are asking memory to read just one byte. if we had an int pointer we might be reading four or eight bytes","width":553},{"text":"but, no, we're reading one byte. while this is non-zero, do something. with C, anything which is a non-zero value is true","width":679},{"text":"what a wonderful simple world","width":185}],

  [{"text":"my love for you is 42","width":170},{"text":"so this means this is going to continue until we get that null byte","width":386},{"text":"alright that's enough hints","width":107},{"text":"let's fixed that code","width":185},{"text":"right so see if you and your neighbor can fix this code faster than your other neighbor that you're not talking to","width":724},{"text":"it's not copying the string, that's one of the bugs","width":3769},{"text":"copy the bytes so actually we didn't just want to copy src into dest ","width":331},{"text":"all this would do is whatever the value of src is whatever the value of src is i is just some memory location, we set that into dest","width":456},{"text":"but dest is just a local variable so that would actually do nothing, it would actually just change src into dest","width":419},{"text":"what we want to do is just use src as a pointer","width":226},{"text":"so we need to put a star in here","width":168},{"text":"there we go","width":38},{"text":"right so we should have read the value at src hey go back to memory and then use dest as a pointer","width":424},{"text":"we wanted to dereference it ","width":75},{"text":"we wanted to say okay now write that value into whatever dest is pointing to","width":269},{"text":"so we've done that, we've copied one byte and we increment both pointers","width":251},{"text":"and then we go back around the loop so we're going to keep writing bytes until we get to the null byte","width":335},{"text":"is my function finished?","width":141},{"text":"no, what's wrong with it?","width":284},{"text":"yes thank you, yes we forgot to copy the null byte","width":289},{"text":"so this function is broken it forgot to copy the null byte","width":266},{"text":"but it might work if you test it if you happen to test it with memory that was already zero","width":417},{"text":"and you think aha I finished my mp","width":162},{"text":"right, no your code is broken","width":178},{"text":"because is forgot to terminate the C string","width":172},{"text":"and then some future function would start reading this and it wouldn't come across a null byte because there would be garbage after it","width":453},{"text":"and it would start printing random characters","width":274},{"text":"until it eventually got to a null byte","width":183},{"text":"of course if it didn't get to a null byte maybe other bad things would happen","width":192},{"text":"anyways so let's fix this","width":123},{"text":"we needed one more line to say after the while loop ","width":157},{"text":"alright the src should be a null byte which I could write like this","width":926},{"text":"okay here's another example of a classic C error which is when you've got two pointers you're probably using the wrong one","width":629},{"text":"okay so make sure that we change the very last byte at the end to be a zero byte","width":372},{"text":"so we terminate it","width":113},{"text":"we could have also fixed this by using a do while loop instead of a while loop","width":506},{"text":"so we would have only done the check at the very end","width":137},{"text":"we would have copied at least one byte","width":128},{"text":"alright so that was my string copy","width":156},{"text":"how about something that actually duplicates strings","width":424},{"text":"right so we want something that takes a character to some memory and we are going to make a new memory object","width":642},{"text":"and we're going to copy the contents of the original into our new piece of memory","width":347},{"text":"right so how do I get some new memory? easy I remember what I said ten minutes ago and say malloc","width":610},{"text":"so I've got malloc I've got the right size I copy.. whoops wait a moment I've got two pointers am I using them in the wrong direction?","width":673},{"text":"if in doubt, yes I probably am right?","width":159},{"text":"how do we check?

maybe it's being used for another variable in which case we've just overwritten the value of another variable","width":636},{"text":"and that is how many C programs are vulnerable to buffer overflow","width":407},{"text":"that is how you could hack into say, a web application which didn't put enough space on a buffer","width":735},{"text":"and you could then overwrite nearby variables","width":290}],

AH. we want to compile it in debug mode","width":537},{"text":"okay there we go, right","width":79},{"text":"so this time we, haha, yes! this time we remembered to include the assert.h and assert is actually a macro. it expands to include that underscore underscore line thing","width":837},{"text":"and underscore underscore file","width":86},{"text":"so now, here we go, when we run this, it prints out program.c at line 15 inside my function main assertion 3<7*0","width":578},{"text":"it's pretty useful. it actually shows you the expression","width":163},{"text":"it's a nice simple development thing to use asserts","width":329},{"text":"because then you can check that people that are calling your functions are actually giving you say valid arguments","width":317},{"text":"and you can check that your assumptions are correct before you try to write complicated code","width":344},{"text":"and, it kills your program. it aborts","width":203},{"text":"so that's assert","width":302},{"text":"now then, pretty easy to use, remember to include it, include...assert.h and then, and then inside your program you just say assert and write an expression you expect to be true","width":1181},{"text":"like \"Hey! its wednesday!\"","width":184},{"text":"if that expression is true, nothing happens","width":206},{"text":"and in fact, when you make a release build, this expression isn't even tested","width":464},{"text":"this compiles to no code","width":176},{"text":"so it's good for performance","width":230},{"text":"but then you realize that you've been living on the edge. it doesn't actually check it.","width":384},{"text":"and it's a macro, because we want to be able to print out the actual contents of the expression we're going to test.","width":405},{"text":"and also we want to print out the line number. and also it's a macro because we can make the contents of the macro disappear when we do a release build","width":718},{"text":"so, with that, let's see if you can write a version of string cat. and what you want to do for strcat is append the contents of another string onto the end of the first string.","width":1066},{"text":"but, we're not sure that people are giving us valid arguments","width":281},{"text":"so how would you write this so that it aborts if either one of these were NULL ?","width":385},{"text":"what would you write?","width":65},{"text":"so see if you and your neighbor can finish this","width":303}],

  [{"text":"good morning cs241 people. how are you this morning?","width":1248},{"text":"great, how's everybody else?","width":225},{"text":"alright, let's try this again. okay, alright, yes, good morning! you've enrolled in cs241, for better or for worse, you'll learn a little bit about systems programming","width":470},{"text":"and for the next 50 minutes, we are going to talk about some new stuff, some old stuff, some [something] stuff, some blue stuff","width":286},{"text":"I lied about the blue stuff","width":94},{"text":"alright so, all I have to do is open my mouth and talk and type. all you have to do is open your brain and think","width":403},{"text":"how hard can it be?","width":66},{"text":"let's try again: good morning people, how are you?","width":178},{"text":"great!! good morning class.","width":64},{"text":"alright, so, the reason I do that is because maybe we'll get a few brain cells working before we actually dive into this stuff, okay?","width":448},{"text":"so, here's the exciting news. yes there are exams in this course. there's no single midterm. instead, there are multiple choice exams scattered throughout the course","width":674},{"text":"and the first one will be on Friday","width":321},{"text":"yes, so, please come on friday, bring your icard, bring a pencil, and look forwards to multiple choice questions which go over the things we've covered so far","width":601},{"text":"anything we've done in lectures or you've done in previous sections, it's fair game.","width":424},{"text":"okay, so I'm looking to make sure basically that you understand the basics of C programming","width":314},{"text":"so as a result, some of the questions we've got today are to do with [something] in C.","width":313},{"text":"alright so, where's my handout?","width":281},{"text":"okay, let's have a look at this first question then, right","width":461},{"text":"I've written a C process, or any kind of process really, that runs for a long time and it's creating other processes","width":555},{"text":"so for example, it might call fork() and then the child process that you've just created calls exec","width":479},{"text":"but we never wait for our children to finish","width":296},{"text":"but they do. but we never call wait on them","width":161},{"text":"what have we created?","width":160},{"text":"zombies! yes! we've created dead processes, processes that have finished but no one's cleared up after them","width":492},{"text":"now, if you see any zombie movies, you'll discover there's different ways to kill them. right.","width":314},{"text":"but, running away is usually what's recommended in most zombie movies","width":275},{"text":"but fortunately, what we do in C programming is just call wait, and when we do that, the system can kind of clear up the mess left by the zombie","width":617},{"text":"if we don't do that, then eventually, we're unable to create new processes. the system runs out of space","width":539},{"text":"alright so yes, we've created a zombie in this case","width":342},{"text":"so a zombie's a dead process where all we're returning essentially is it's exit status. but it's still taking up a little bit a system resources because we haven't finished cleaning up after itself","width":768},{"text":"and it only happens if no one ever calls wait","width":193},{"text":"so for that, I need a long running process","width":335},{"text":"so let's see what happens in the other case where my child outlives the parent. would you like a handout?","width":461},{"text":"we have a question","width":479},{"text":"that happens when the parent dies. okay?","width":199},{"text":"so that's why the question up there says \"long running parent\". the parent hasn't died. it just doesn't care about its children","width":422},{"text":"the children have finished, alright, perhaps they've called \"exec\" and done an \"ls\", perhaps they finished doing a computation, perhaps they finished serving a webpage to a client.","width":511},{"text":"the point is, the child processes, once they finish, they're still taking up space","width":466},{"text":"alright so, let's not have a look at a zombie. let's have a look at the other case that you just brought up","width":359},{"text":"which is what happens when the parent finishes first?","width":382},{"text":"ok, so, I've got a little bit of code here, and uh, first of all you could ask, what's it actually print? the answer being nothing! because actually if you look at it, you'll see this #if #endif","width":740},{"text":"those are preprocessor directives to tell the preprocessor to say \"well if this expression is true, then include this, otherwise don't\"","width":586},{"text":"and, so of course right now, there is no main method. compiler would never actually see the code we wrote in here","width":379},{"text":"right, I could write garbage in here. like, alright, you know I could write \"superbowl\"","width":492},{"text":"um, and it's not gonna find an error in there because the actual compiler doesn't check for the syntax. it keeps going until there we go","width":520},{"text":"alright um, so let's fix that, let's just say #if 1","width":295},{"text":"okay, right, and we'll run this and a question for you is, before I run it, how many times is it going to print \"I am process\"","width":759},{"text":"cuz you see it happens before fork()","width":102},{"text":"and secondly, who's sleeping? is it the child that's sleeping or is it the parent that's sleeping?","width":674},{"text":"if you made up your mind, tell your neighbor. see if they agree with you","width":483},{"text":"if you're not sure, at least have a guess","width":2192},{"text":"okay! alright! so, who's sleeping? is it the child or the parent?","width":429},{"text":"the child! remember, fork() returns twice, if you like. because, when we call fork, after it executes, we've now got two processes. we've got the original process, and the clone","width":767},{"text":"the doppleganger","width":64},{"text":"that believes it really is the same original process because it can look back in its mind and say \"yes, I was born in kansas\"","width":335},{"text":"right? it remembers all the variable states but its actually got a copy of everything (well, nearly everything)","width":461},{"text":"but there's one asymmetric difference which is that, if you're the child, your return value of fork() is zero","width":436},{"text":"so we are asking the child to sleep()","width":272},{"text":"okay, meanwhile then, both processes carry on independently, you can imagine them running on two different CPUs","width":482},{"text":"they're completely different processes. just like you can be running Minecraft and working on your chemistry homework at the same time","width":513},{"text":"and we print something out. we print out our pid and our parent's id. so let's run this...see what happens","width":576}],
  // Part 1
  [{"text":"alright, so, the first surpise is that we see 'I am process' twice","width":956},{"text":"that's weird, why did that happen? let's talk about in a moment","width":177},{"text":"and then second thing is one of the processes said:","width":248},{"text":"and my parent is 1","width":289},{"text":"okay, how, why? well remember we made the child sleep. we made it sleep for an extra second. in that second it's original parent finished","width":686},{"text":"it exited. so now what are we going to do with the child now? who's parent should it be?","width":231},{"text":"and now's where the system says 'I know what! we will reparent you back to the ultimate process' parent process id one","width":643},{"text":"so that's what happened there. if we didn't have this sleep then we have a race condition. maybe the parent finished first, maybe the child would've finished first","width":495},{"text":"we cannot say for sure who would finish first so that's why we put the sleep in","width":286},{"text":"okay, but why is it that we saw 'I am process' twice?","width":321},{"text":"OK, if you think you have the answer wave your hand in the air like you just don't care. you care","width":415},{"text":"alright, very good yes. okay! so, a few people know. i'll give you a hint","width":528},{"text":"I'm going to change the program very slightly by putting '\\n' in there","width":802},{"text":"and now you only get 'I am process' once. so by putting ","width":439},{"text":"'\\n' in there I changed the output of the program quite significantly. what does '\\n' do?","width":784},{"text":"yeah! thanks. in our little example here, C decides to flush the buffers. so there's abuffer inside the process and it's just collecting bytes. just collecting the characters to print out","width":920},{"text":"but it didn't bother to actually write them out to the system yet. it only decided to do that when we saw the new lines. so in this example we ended up callling write(), we printed it out, before we called fork()","width":931},{"text":"in the first example it was still inside the process so when we forked it was still there inside the child as well. the child says 'oh yeah,I've still got these bytes to print out. I haven't got round to it yet'","width":798},{"text":"so be wary about this. the other thing to note is that at the very end of the program part of the clean up that the C library does is says 'hey ok any open file descriptors if you have something to write out do it now because this process is closing. it's time to flush all the buffers' so it does that as part of the standard clean up process","width":1464},{"text":"right, so that's a little example there. how much buffering actually happens depends partly on wheter your trying to send it to a terminal or a file","width":1059},{"text":"if you're sending stuff to a file it will actually keep buffering beyond the '\\n' so it tries to have even better performance by buffering stuff out to a larger amount before writing them","width":952},{"text":"questions about this example?","width":207},{"text":"yes?","width":288},{"text":"right, so if we choosed fprintf() ","width":382},{"text":"aha, OK, right, so puts() is equivalent to printf() %s \\n. OK so that would've actually flushed it as well","width":1170},{"text":"and so if I used fprintf() the same thing would've happened if I sent it to standard out because the buffer of standard out by default when I'm sending it to the terminal is to wait until I say new line","width":714},{"text":"if I send it to standard error, well lets just do it. we would have seen it once because the default for standard error is just to push things out. we don't want to wait, we're not trying to get high perforance. you want to know your error messages as soon as possible just in case the process dies very quickly","width":1427},{"text":"alright, so, if we wanted... remember how I said we've got somewhat of a race condition? I've just put in a sleep for a second and that kind of works on this particular system","width":727},{"text":"if we wanted to actually wait for our child ","width":550},{"text":"then I can call waitpid(). so how's waitpid()? let's check the old man page. waitpid","width":1273},{"text":"so, you see we pass in the pid we got from fork. we can get some status information and there's some flags as well that we don't need today","width":872},{"text":"so what we'll change now in our output? ok, what's our little error here? ","width":649},{"text":"oh I didn't declare a little variable. there we go","width":832},{"text":"OK so this time the parent of the child is still the, huh. OK.","width":1420},{"text":"why would that be? so the parent is waiting for the - oh. okay, yeah we called waitpid() on two, we should only be doing that inside the parent, so let's do that for the parent. so if I'm the parent then ","width":1435},{"text":"we'll wait for our child to sleep","width":399},{"text":"OK yeah now thats sorted, that makes sense. right, so, what've we got there? the orignal one is 198 and it's parent is 43 which is probably this little shell program here that's running and the child is 199 and it's child is 198 so we should have two numbers right which are the same","width":1367},{"text":"this is the child saying 'oh look here's my parent 198 and this is our original program 198 saying my parent is 43'","width":624},{"text":"so, you can actually discover all the processes running on your system. this one doesn't have that many and I don't know if you've got pstree involved","width":728},{"text":"you can use ps and pstree to kinda get a hierarchal view of all the processes that a process has. there's different options to say OK, I want to know about my process or everybodys processes but don't worry that's not on the test, okie dokie...","width":1056}],
  // Part 2
  [{"text":"so, now it's time to talk about signals","width":240},{"text":"unless anybodys got any last minute burning questions","width":263},{"text":"ok, right, signals are called. there's a lot to signals we're just going to do an introductory part today","width":446},{"text":"but signals are the software equivalent of hardware interrupts","width":379},{"text":"so, think about hardware for a moment ","width":208},{"text":"i can have things like a clock timer that goes off every say hundred milliseconds ","width":414},{"text":"and interrupts what the CPU is currently doing","width":173},{"text":"and when the CPU sees that it says 'oh I'd better stop doing what I'm currently executing' and run some additional code thats gonna cope with the fact that my little clock timer has gone off","width":692},{"text":"or I've got some bytes from the disk which are ready to read and I want to stop what I'm doing and execute some different code","width":434},{"text":"or some information on the USB bus has arrived like someone plugged in a USB keyboard or typed something and I need to handle those bytes","width":564},{"text":"right, so interrupts allow us to stop doing what we're currently doing and process some different code","width":384},{"text":"we could do the same thing with hardware and that's signals","width":183},{"text":"and, we can send signals to our children and we can get a signal back evern when one of our children dies, which is useful","width":663},{"text":"and we can have a lot of fun with them because they can do differnt things","width":488},{"text":"so, first of all, that's a list of all the processes","width":436},{"text":"let me send a signal to one of these processes","width":299},{"text":"so, uhh, ok, do I have a pid variable here? no I don't. okay so, let me just send -9","width":559},{"text":"to say process 43. what've I just done?","width":548},{"text":"yeah, I've killed myself","width":145},{"text":"ok, the kill command says 'send a singal' and -9 is the ultimate of signals - hint hint - terminate this thing with [something] it can't stop this signal","width":992},{"text":"if you send this signal to a process that process is gone","width":422},{"text":"there's no way to protect against this signal","width":296},{"text":"this is the big weight falling on top of a signal. this is how you can kill processes","width":232},{"text":"so if you know - if you are a superuser and you know a processes id, you can get rid of it","width":645},{"text":"OK, so fortunately I have another processes here. let's see if this one works","width":493},{"text":"unfortunately I can't actually write any code so it's time to reboot my machine","width":896},{"text":"okay, so! we can do something similar in our programs as well","width":391},{"text":"let's pull up some example code here","width":2347},{"text":"alright, we won't do that straight away, ok, so here's some typical fork exec() code","width":375},{"text":"the child decides to run /bin/ls and the parent will do something else","width":758},{"text":"so, let's first of all just start off with this. there's nothing new in this code, I just want to prove to you that the child runs exec() here and should print something out","width":773},{"text":"here we go, so yeah we'll move on it. the child runs","width":205},{"text":"okay now, what we'll do this time is I'm going to make the child sleep for one second because now I'm going to call kill() from my program here. I think you can guess what's going to happen here","width":701},{"text":"alright so, we'll check kill() on section 2 and you'll see that we can send a signal to a process","width":734},{"text":"alright so, we have the id that we wanted to call, there it is, it's called child, and what should we send it? well let's send it signal 9","width":1114},{"text":"oh, we had a sleep there. so this time you'll see the poor child never got to run /bin/ls, we klled it and it didnt' stand a chance","width":637},{"text":"we could also send a signal called SIGINT, in fact, rather than send it to the child, why don't we send it to ourselves","width":893},{"text":"let's do it straight away","width":249},{"text":"I wonder what SIGINT stands for","width":478},{"text":"ok, so the SIG is a standard thing you'll see prepended toward the singal of different names","width":446},{"text":"INT stands for interrupt","width":188},{"text":"remember how you can press ctrl+c and the program stopped? this is how it works","width":441},{"text":"the shell says 'oh look, look, someones trying to press ctrl+c, I will send SIGINT to the running process'","width":488},{"text":"and that's how we break our processes","width":594},{"text":"well, this is where the fun begins. I don't have to see my processes die when you press ctrl+c","width":572},{"text":"we can do other things for the SIGINT and for that we're going to look at SIGACTION","width":649},{"text":"SIGACTION allows us to register a callback function that's going to be run when the signal is given to this process","width":690},{"text":"ok, so, here's how sigaction() works. I didn't want to use sigaction(), I was going to use the simpler version","width":1042},{"text":"yeah, let's use signal() ","width":994},{"text":"we'll talk about sigaction() later on in the course","width":297},{"text":"ok, this is what I wanted to show you. so our typedef here. is that large enough for people? can I make it larger?","width":685},{"text":"can you read that at the back?","width":256}],
  // Part 3
  [{"text":"okay alright so, we've got a typedef that say \"typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int)\"","width":404},{"text":"and then this sighandler underscore t. let's talk about this for a moment. as to how to parse this","width":868},{"text":"alright, so we know that typedef just really means \"hey! I'm an alias\" I'm just defining a new type and in this case, this is a function pointer","width":752},{"text":"so, we can [something] this by unpacking it from the inside out. so, we can have a function that takes an integer","width":586},{"text":"and returns nothing","width":271},{"text":"and, our type goes in the middle (between the parenthesis)","width":196},{"text":"so have a pointer to a function. in other words, just, where do we want to send the CPU to actually execute some code? here's our little function that's gonna happen","width":584},{"text":"and then I can install this handler for a particular signal","width":260},{"text":"so should a certain signal happen, run this handler","width":246},{"text":"alright, so, let's do that","width":513},{"text":"I'm gonna have a signal handle then. and I can call it noway. I can call it anything I want, really.","width":559},{"text":"remember it takes a void. call it agentsmith alright, you'll see why in a moment. and remember it takes an int","width":858},{"text":"so, at this point, we'll write something out. like, \"you can't stop me!\"","width":549},{"text":"okay, how many letters is that? who knows? about 13","width":363},{"text":"and, we want this to run anytime someone tries to stop this program","width":214},{"text":"so, let's use that signal() thing","width":153},{"text":"so we'll say signal when I get a SIGINT, run agentsmith","width":675},{"text":"and, then i'll have a little loop that does a. keeps itself busy. while(1) loop forever","width":460},{"text":"so, while true, keep going","width":117},{"text":"alright so, let's run this little program here","width":851},{"text":"okay, off it goes, and let's try and press Ctrl-C","width":479},{"text":"oh no! alright, you can't stop agent smith here. anytime you press Ctrl-C, that signal is delivered and fortunately, you can press Ctrl-\\ and that should","width":876},{"text":"okay, there we go, alright. I can at least Ctrl-Z it so I can actually stop the program. so something else to show gives me the ability to pause the program.","width":506},{"text":"and if I wish, I could actually put that into the background. does it support it? okay, yeah, it does and now its in the background","width":617},{"text":"and now it's just running and using up my CPU","width":181},{"text":"if I do \"ps\", there it is. it's running. it's used up 32 seconds, now its used up 34 seconds of CPU, I'd better kill it.","width":502},{"text":"okay, kill minus 9 106","width":235},{"text":"it's gone! remember, SIGINT you cannot stop. so you could try to. sorry, SIGKILL or SIGTERM you cannot stop SIGTERM","width":784},{"text":"alright let's go back","width":195},{"text":"right, so let's first see what it's going to do with child processes. here's the whole thing. let's change our message to say \"child finished\"","width":631},{"text":"and this time, we will make our message a string here so char mesg","width":736},{"text":"I can get a signal when one of my children dies","width":325},{"text":"so strlen(mesg)","width":270},{"text":"okay, right, so, write out the number of bytes that's in that message","width":536},{"text":"so now, rather than doing SIGINT, guess what, there's something called SIGCHILD","width":364},{"text":"and let's make this a little larger","width":354},{"text":"and this time rather than looping forever, we'll do our fork() and now when the child is finished running ls, why did it, oh, aha!","width":1672},{"text":"that's not gonna be very useful, okay.","width":329},{"text":"we'll get rid of the sleep() there as well","width":341},{"text":"so, this time, the child runs ls hopefully, oh, no.","width":367},{"text":"SIG, oh, I can't spell","width":195},{"text":"yes, for some reason, CHLD is spelled without the I","width":272},{"text":"I guess bytes were expensive in those days? okay, alright so, hooray! here's what we've got","width":769},{"text":"the child ran and then the parent was notified asynchronously that the child finished","width":506},{"text":"so if you wanted to do some stuff in the background and you're worried about zombies, this is the perfect place to put that waitpid","width":475},{"text":"to say \"hey! I need to clean up my children\"","width":156},{"text":"so that's in fact a very common convention with these kinds of programs","width":334},{"text":"is, if you don't want to just fork() and then wait() immediately, just write yourself one of these signal handlers and then we can put our waitpid in here","width":595},{"text":"so, we'll need to know the child id, we have a status variable, and a zero here, okay","width":724},{"text":"the last thing I need to do here is that child itself [something] out of scope here. so instead, let me declare as a global variable","width":723},{"text":"now, global variables in large programs considered [something] programming practices. however, you will often see them in small, single-file system programming examples","width":943},{"text":"because it's an easy way to communicate with signal handlers","width":401},{"text":"alright so now, okay, well, you can imagine if I was actually able to type, you can see that we're being good citizens and we're cleaning up our children using a signal handler","width":896}],
  // Part 4

I'll walk around in case anyone's got any questions","width":18098},{"text":"ok, so, that assert() call at the beginning. the nice thing about assert() in production code it disappears, there's no performance overhead. it's not even evalutated","width":693},{"text":"the macro compiles to nothing, so the purpose of this is during debugging I want to catch early if someone gives me a bad pointer","width":585},{"text":"right, so if we say character result, then anytime we use the variable result in the future it will point to the beginning of the array ","width":432},{"text":"sounds great, we can use up to 256 bytes, in other words a string with 256 pics, 255 letters and a 0 byte at the end which fits","width":490},{"text":"however, this is an automatic variable stored on the stack, which means it's scope is only for the length of this function","width":627},{"text":"and, if we try to store anything in here, that's ok, but it becomes meaningless after the function returns","width":537},{"text":"so, yes, we can return a pointer to this array, but don't expect that memory to be valid after the function returns","width":444},{"text":"so, that's no good. we need memory that's going to exist for longer than that","width":307},{"text":"so we turn to malloc() to say 'hey give me some memory on the heap please'","width":239}],

  [{"text":"Okay, good morning class, how are you?  Fantastic, right!  So here's what we're going to start doing now, we're going to start talking about memory.","width":1647},{"text":"You could imagine if we went back into the early, early hours of computing, we had it easy, right?  Well, there's proper instructions here, and we'll use location 100 to mean this and 112 to mean that, and we won't have to worry about dynamic memory allocation; we'll just make all those decisions upfront as we actually design the program.","width":1606},{"text":"Then later, we say, \"Well actually, we want to have functions.\"  And later, we want to have functions that can call themselves and be able to recurse.  So, for that we need a stack.","width":782},{"text":"And for that, then, as we make function calls, our stack pointer needs to move.  And inside the stack we'll store our temporary variables and also our point where the CPU should go back to when it returns from the function.","width":1256},{"text":"So our stack... we'll start a lot higher up in memory and as we make more recursive calls our stack will get larger and larger and larger and larger, of course - until we run out of memory.  And then we said, \"Well actually, we don't want to decide what memory we'll need upfront either, we want to be able to have dynamic memory allocation, and we don't know when we're going to free up that memory.  We don't know when we've finished with it.  We want to make that completely dynamic and it's part of our program.","width":1836},{"text":"And thus, the idea of the heap was born.","width":173},{"text":"The idea that at any point, we can say, \"Oh!  I need more memory!  And give it to me now and this is how much I want and I'm not going to tell you when I'll be finished with it.\"","width":703},{"text":"So it's very different from the stack memory.  Stack memory: you know you'll be finished with that memory when you return from the function.","width":530},{"text":"So with stack memory, you've got automatic variables.  They automatically disappear - no more work...","width":335},{"text":"With the heap, of course, now we actually have to say, \"Okay, give me the memory\" and \"I'm finished with it.\"","width":452},{"text":"So you've used the heap of course in Java and in C++ when you said 'new' and 'delete' in C++.  Typically, they go on the heap memory.","width":732},{"text":"I say 'typically' because C++ can do some amazing optimizations when you're not looking the compiler will quickly say, \"Hey!  You didn't need to write that!\"","width":554},{"text":"\"Here!  I'll optimize your code, so that actually there's no code written at all.\"","width":251},{"text":"When you write new/delete you explicitly create, well, we'll just simplify it and say \"Yes!\"  We're making things on the heap.  So we need some memory, so let's call malloc().","width":705},{"text":"So malloc() is part of the C-library.  It's part of your process.  It decides where your memory's going to be.","width":616},{"text":"If you like, it says, \"Oh look!  Table of four.  Right, I need  four seats.  You can sit over here.  This table over here is free.  You sit over here.  Oh, you've finished with that table?  Oh, great!  Get out of there because I'm going to reuse this table for something else.\"","width":815},{"text":"Alright, so malloc() has to very quickly decide where it can assign you some memory.","width":479},{"text":"Now, it gets harder because we don't know in which order our memory is going to be allocated, and in which order memory is going to be freed.","width":1070},{"text":"And even if you knew that order, it's an NP hard problem to do it well.","width":534},{"text":"Called the Knapsack Problem.","width":148},{"text":"So even if you knew exactly which order the malloc()s and free()s were going to come in, how would you do it efficiently is a non-trivial problem.","width":594},{"text":"That sounds computationally expensive, right?  If we made our malloc() perfect, it's going to take a long time.  \"Yeah, I could put this table of two here, but you know what there's a big order coming in in a moment and so I don't actually want to put them there I want to put them over there.\"  There's an infinite number of possible ways that we could arrange things in memory.","width":1304},{"text":"So malloc() has to be efficient but fast.","width":360},{"text":"So this is the basic game we have to play.","width":320},{"text":"*picture problems*","width":1298},{"text":"Don't write this down, this is just a visual.

Good.","width":199},{"text":"So my little blocks here indicate 1 kilobyte blocks.","width":311},{"text":"And during the execution of my program it says, \"Well, I'm gonna make a linked list or I'm gonna make an image, and I need some memory.\"  So part of your code says, \"I need say 2 KB.\"","width":1099},{"text":"So malloc() now has to look through the memory and say, \"I tell you what, I'll give you these two blocks here.\"","width":515},{"text":"If anyone else calls malloc() I promise not to return any pointers that point to this memory in here.","width":449},{"text":"So malloc() is going to return the address of the first few bytes and internally it has to do some book-keeping.  It has to make a note that these first 2 KB are being used.","width":845},{"text":"And then your program decides to malloc() some more memory.  So it says, \"Okay, I'll have 2KB now please.\"  What should malloc() do now?","width":874},{"text":"Well, it can't use this area of memory.  It has a choice: it could put it here and here.  It's not going to allocate here and here, though.","width":1030},{"text":"Why not? Why does it not say, \"I'll give you some memory there and there\"?","width":585},{"text":"Yes! Thank you, we've fragmented the memory, but also when malloc() returns a pointer, your assumption is that all the bytes you've been given are contiguous.  You might want to use it as just a simple array, for example.","width":1232},{"text":"So we've got a problem here.  We have to allocate memory that is in the same area so let's say we put these little x's in here.  And then of course someone says, \"malloc(2 KB)\".  What happens now?","width":1455},{"text":"We can't! right? We don't have enough spare memory.","width":320}],
  // Part 1
  [{"text":"Now if this was a very small... two things could happen: our program could just crash - malloc() could just give a bad answer.  But we want to be a bit more systematic than that.  So at this point we'll go back to the operating system and say, \"Hey!  You know that memory stuff that's really valuable?  Give me some more, I need some more.\"  So actually malloc() at that point has to go back to the operating system and say, \"Hey, you know that memory you gave me?  I've run out.\"","width":2033},{"text":"I need some more. I'm addicted to the stuff, right? So, I need more memory.  So malloc() can get some more memory from the operating system. there we go.","width":733},{"text":"How does it do that?  Well, classically it would call something like sbrk().","width":640},{"text":"What is sbrk()? You can write this bit down if you want to.  Let's jump into the rabbit hole for a moment and think about our process where we've got all these memory addresses to play with.  ","width":1328},{"text":"So what do we find inside memory?  We've got our code, we've got our global variables or the static variables... up here we've got the environment and the stack...where's our heap live?","width":2355},{"text":"Just here.  It starts off just here.","width":547},{"text":"So it can grow, right?  We can say, \"Excuse me, system.  I actually need some more space.\"  And that's what sbrk() does.","width":596},{"text":"It says, \"Look, you've got this watermark (this threshold) of what the maximum address is.  I want to bump it up, I want to play with some more room.\"","width":1329},{"text":"So this means we could write a really, really simple memory allocator.  Here it is.","width":521},{"text":"Any time the program asks for more memory (x bytes) all we will do is say to the system, \"Hey!  I need more bytes.  This is the number I need.\"","width":999},{"text":"And anytime the program decides it's finished with some bytes, what should we do?","width":932},{"text":"Nothing!","width":119},{"text":"That's the simplest memory allocator we could write.","width":332},{"text":"It's not a very good one, though.  We're not re-using any memory.","width":608},{"text":"Because we're not keeping track of which pieces of memory are actually being allocated.  We're just simply saying, \"Oh look!  I've got some more passengers on my boat, I need a bigger boat.\"  Or, \"I've got more people on my bus, I need a bigger bus.\"","width":682},{"text":"And not keeping track of how many seats are actually unoccupied.","width":330},{"text":"So it's really, really fast but completely inefficient.  We're very quickly going to exhaust all of our memory.","width":500},{"text":"And so this sets the stage now for our memory allocator.  We actually need to start keeping track of which bytes are currently being used and which bytes are available for suitable calls to malloc().","width":854},{"text":"So we only want to call this sbrk() thing when we truly are out of memory.  When we have no way to allocate any more memory.  ","width":984},{"text":"So the MP (which will be out maybe the end of the week or maybe next week) is actually going to ask you to write an efficient malloc().  And it fact it's going to be a competition.","width":1056},{"text":"So there'll be a page with results and you can see if your malloc() is faster than your neighbor's malloc().","width":616},{"text":"So remember when they step away from the keyboard to put a sleep() call into their code.","width":505},{"text":"Okay, so what's to stop you from doing this all the time?  Easy: the competition is actually going to put a hard limit on the amount of memory that you are allowed to play with.","width":839},{"text":"So now we have to start coping with the fact that memory's being freed.","width":975},{"text":"So if we are working with writing a good malloc(), let me show you a little problem that we might run into.","width":1025},{"text":"Here's some memory that's been allocated.  Here's some other memory that's been allocated at different times.  And then our program says, \"You know what?  I'd like 2 KB.\"","width":1354},{"text":"Now you can see from my little diagram that I've actually got 3 KB of memory which are unused.","width":631},{"text":"But I cannot give you 2 KB.  I cannot find any space which is 2 KB because my spare space has all been fragmented.  It's no longer in a contiguous block.","width":1202},{"text":"So why can't I just take all the contents of this memory and just move it into there, and then carry on?","width":673},{"text":"Why can't I just move that?","width":232},{"text":"Why can't my malloc() just start shuffling stuff around?","width":365},{"text":"Yes, thank you! Yeah, I can copy stuff!  My malloc() can copy it to there.  However, the rest of my process is using pointers.  It assumes that the stuff that's inside here is where it is so it assumes that if I've got a variable that's pointing to a linked list that it's using this area.  ","width":1401},{"text":"So all those pointers will be invalid.","width":256}],
  // Part 2
  [{"text":"So malloc() by itself cannot do that.","width":763},{"text":"Java does a little trick here, by the way.  What Java does is its pointers are actually pointers to pointers.","width":645},{"text":"So remember when you had a pointer to something, like an object pointer?  And next time someone says, \"But there are no pointers in Java!\"  And then you say to them, \"Well why does Java have a 'null pointer exception?\"","width":1157},{"text":"So how does this work internally?","width":462},{"text":"This pointer points to a pointer which points to the actual memory that Java's using.","width":623},{"text":"Why does Java do that?  So that it can shuffle things around.  So that it can deal with this fragmentation problem.","width":661},{"text":"So here's what we're trying to solve here is fragmentation.","width":545},{"text":"And the reason I mentioned this thing about Java is because when you are using the JNI, on the Android NDK, you are going to discover that you have to pin and release things.","width":1334},{"text":"As part of your C code.  And what you're doing is you're saying (to this intermediate pointer), \"Oh no no no, I've got a bunch of C code right now that is using this data, so you can't start moving these things around.  You can't shuffle this block of memory around right now because my C code is using it.\"","width":1655},{"text":"So Java uses a counting mechanism to note that C code is currently using these pointers and can't shuffle the memory contents.","width":709},{"text":"You'll discover this stuff when you start working on the Android NDK challenge.","width":559},{"text":"Right, so, our game then is to try to avoid this fragmentation.","width":406},{"text":"This fragmentation's bad, right?  Now we have memory that we can't use for large allocations.","width":366},{"text":"Our game is also to do this efficiently.","width":212},{"text":"So, here's where we're gonna look at three little problems.","width":810},{"text":"So this is actually an exam question.  It's one of the easier exam questions.  And what we're gonna do is forget for a moment this whole stuff about sbrk() and going back to the system to get more memory.","width":941},{"text":"We'll just say that we've got a heap initially of 13 KB.","width":798},{"text":"And we've got an order of calls.","width":670},{"text":"So as new calls come in, we can decide where to put them.  And here's three different placement strategies.","width":667},{"text":"Best fit, worst fit, and first fit.","width":392},{"text":"And we'll see as we do this that they lead to different assignments, that our malloc() will decide to place these requests in different parts of memory and so we'll have different fragmentation so that if our program continued, we might discover that future large allocations are impossible.","width":1537},{"text":"ok, so what do we need to know about this?","width":302},{"text":"First of all, if you've got a choice, you choose the earliest segment.","width":521},{"text":"Okay, so what that might mean is let's say with best fit, let's say I've got space here of 2 (which happens to be a perfect fit; in other words, I'm trying to find space for 2 K, then I would just choose the one with a smaller memory address.","width":1982},{"text":"Worst fit.  Oh, how contrary can you be?  The idea here is that if I've got a space which gives me the maximum amount of space after I've done the allocation, I'll use that.","width":1351},{"text":"Okay, so let's have a look at worst fit, where I've got a 2K space here and a 10K space there and I'm trying to allocate 2 KB.","width":776},{"text":"Worst fit would not put it in this spot here, it would break apart this 10 KB space and say, \"I'll tell you what: here's how we'll change.  I'll allocate my 2 KB there, giving me a remaining space of 8.\"","width":1213},{"text":"What do you think first fit does?","width":291},{"text":"Pretty obvious, right, from it's name.  We're simply going to walk along our free spaces until we find the one which is sufficiently large, and use that.","width":1125},{"text":"So, if I'm looking for 2K, oh look!  There it is, I'll use that one.  If I'm looking for 3K, oh, it's not gonna work for me, I'll have to keep searching. Okay?","width":762},{"text":"So they're very obvious placement strategies (from their names).  Now, it's up to you to actually run them.","width":534},{"text":"So here's the actual order of calls to malloc() and free().  Where do the allocations end up?","width":320}],
  // Part 3
  [{"text":"There was a question about best fit.  Best fit will scan through, looking at all the possible holes.  Obviously we can ignore all the holes (or spaces) which are too small.","width":961},{"text":"And it will use the space which is at least as large as the request, but hopefully no larger.  And if it so happens that there's two spaces that satisfy that search, then we use the one lowest in memory.","width":1372},{"text":"So, question?","width":1072},{"text":"You would split it at the beginning. Right so, anytime you've got a space, you do the allocation at the beginning of the space.","width":1472},{"text":"*nothing happens here*","width":4224},{"text":"*again nothing, class discussion, Angrave filling out sheet*","width":6458},{"text":"Okay, so.  Let's have a look at this.  So first fit: I've gotten as far as filling out A, B, and C and now I've called free() on B, and now I need to allocate another 3 KB.  Where could we put it?","width":768},{"text":"Well, we've got space here and we've got space at the end.  And we're trying to do best fit.  So best fit is going to put it in here because it's a perfect fit.  If I put it starting at 3K, I would've had a space of one left over, so that's not quite as good.","width":1221},{"text":"And then we free A, and we allocate one KB.  Where could we put this?  Well, there's only one place.  There's one big giant space over here.","width":780},{"text":"So we'll put E there.","width":548},{"text":"What happens in worst fit?","width":542},{"text":"Nothing changes at the beginning here.  C, C, C.  Okay, so.  Now we free() B.","width":812},{"text":"And we allocate 3 KB.","width":160},{"text":"So: where's our choice?","width":68},{"text":"We could stick it here, or we could stick it at the end.  Which one is worst fit gonna use?","width":467},{"text":"B, yes!","width":42},{"text":"Because we have the largest space if we allocate it there.","width":245},{"text":"So let's put our D in here.","width":520},{"text":"And now we free() A.","width":304},{"text":"And we want to allocate one byte.  So what are our choices?  We've got a space of 3, space of 1, and space of 3.  Where's worst fit gonna put our final allocation?","width":747},{"text":"Yeah, it's a tie-up between the first few blocks here and the last few, so we'll put it just here.","width":313},{"text":"Okay, and first fit","width":93},{"text":"Okay, let's do this quick. ","width":829},{"text":"Right, so, we'll do the D.  3KB.  First fit is the Scrappy-Doo of fits.  As soon as we find enough space, we'll stop.  And we've just cleared out our space of four so yes, we can put D in here.","width":1258},{"text":"And now we'd free A, and finally we allocate 1 KB.  So we run along our spaces - oh, look!  Here's our free one.  And we'll stick E in here.","width":821},{"text":"I'm sorry, yes, you're right.  We'll stick it just there.","width":606},{"text":"Okay, so this was a pretty trivial exercise.  But what I wanted to show you is the mechanics of these programs, and that they also lead to spaces in different places.  Also, there's a little thing that we did quite easily but you'll have to remember to do in code, which is: look at this, we had A and B, and at some point we freed up two allocations next to each other.  And so we had to go from thinking that this is a space of two and a space of four into think that this is just one big space of 6.  And if we didn't do that, then if somebody asked for a malloc() of 6, then your algorithm would say, \"I'm sorry, I don't have space to allocate 6B because counting will keep this as a space of 2 and a space of 4.\"","width":3621},{"text":"We could coalesce those two free areas together into a single block, and so that is a common gotcha when implementing malloc().","width":610},{"text":"That you have to look at the space beforehand and the space afterwards to see if you can coalesce them.","width":448}],
  // Part 4
  [{"text":"Right, um..","width":152},{"text":"No need to need to remember that until you actually write your own allocator","width":308},{"text":"Okay, so let's just think about some of the comparisons of these then","width":265},{"text":"So what we'll do first here: what's one of the advantages of first fit?","width":403},{"text":"It's fast! As soon as it finds some space, hey we're done! We don't need to do any more","width":574},{"text":"Okay, what's one of the advantages, say of best fit? Or any disadvantages? Yes?","width":698},{"text":"Okay, so, think it's least amount of fragmentation","width":621},{"text":"Because it's ideal!","width":685},{"text":"Okay, so that is uh, do we know that for sure?","width":389},{"text":"It appears to be from this example, right?","width":248},{"text":"But is it true? In all possible uses?","width":643},{"text":"What about disadvantages?","width":303},{"text":"It's slower than what? first fit","width":471},{"text":"Because we have to check all spaces","width":630},{"text":"Okay, let's do worst fit and I'll come back to this one","width":122},{"text":"Right, what about worst fit?","width":370},{"text":"Yes, it's slower than first fit again because now we have to go through","width":615},{"text":"Any advantages to it?","width":180},{"text":"Any other disadvantages to it?","width":378},{"text":"Let's think about what we're doing for a moment.","width":61},{"text":"So worst fit is always going to find the largest space and use that","width":401},{"text":"So that means in a longer-running program, if you've got a giant space, it's going to quickly be eaten up","width":348},{"text":"So with worst fit, what you find is that you end up with lots of kind of medium-sized spaces","width":536},{"text":"Yes? Uh yeah, we can always go back to the system and say, \"Hey, system, I need some more memory\"","width":587},{"text":"But what we're trying to do is see what our fragmentation looks like given the space we've got","width":340},{"text":"Okay? so, because we keep attacking the largest space, means that we don't have one large area should a giant allocation request come in","width":766},{"text":"Alright, now we've got these medium-sized holes, these medium-sized spaces, scattered all over our memory space","width":588},{"text":"So we cannot satisfy very large requests","width":257},{"text":"Yes? But we keep attacking that large block, right? It's um","width":809},{"text":"I'm trying to think of a good analogy, but uhh","width":226},{"text":"You always can say, \"Oh look, I've got this really really big block at the end, I'll keep using that\"","width":307},{"text":"Now what we haven't talked about is think about the fact that our memory gets freed up as well, okay?","width":339},{"text":"So, this large block keeps getting attacked, and we end up with smaller, medium-sized blocks scattered through our memory if we run this process for long enough","width":913},{"text":"We're always attacking the largest space, we're always kind of nibbling bits off it","width":356},{"text":"So best fit seems to be, \"Hey, we're not going to get much fragmentation, we're always trying to find the perfect jigsaw puzzle\"","width":488},{"text":"The problem with, yeah?","width":423},{"text":"Yeah, yeah there are some interesting caching issues, yes","width":2476},{"text":"Okay, okay, okay, so the question's about, \"hold on, we've got virtual space, with virtual memory you can actually do some interesting mapping to real memory\"","width":560},{"text":"Yes, that is true","width":124},{"text":"However, that mapping happens at four kilobyte chunks","width":238},{"text":"Um, so, we can't completely get away from our fragmentation issue","width":584},{"text":"So, yes, underneath this for the real memory, we can avoid some fragmentation","width":477},{"text":"Given that malloc actually has some space, you know it's got a low address and a high address, our question is how can we efficiently use this memory?","width":410},{"text":"Right, so, I want to address this least fragmentation thing","width":185},{"text":"It appears to be ideal. It can be, if you set up your simulation correctly, but when you, uh, run it under more realistic conditions, what tends to happen is you end up with lots and lots of tiny, tiny, tiny little holes. Or tiny pieces of spaces.","width":1079},{"text":"So you could imagine that you've got, say, a request comes in four 15 kilobytes and you happen to have a 16 kilobyte space free, so you'll use that","width":758},{"text":"Now you end up with this tiny 1 kilobyte unused space","width":301},{"text":"So, in practice, best fit tends to give you these tiny, tiny spaces which are difficult to reuse","width":799},{"text":"So, quite often, some variant of first fit actually turns out to be a pretty good choice","width":363},{"text":"What first fit tends to do is the size of the holes tends to vary as you walk further down your list of free spaces","width":636},{"text":"So, this is actually often a pretty good choice","width":434},{"text":"Okay, so that was placement strategies","width":324},{"text":"Let's talk about a few other things with memory","width":373},{"text":"So we talked about where it's stored in memory","width":122},{"text":"It's stored just above the code and the global variables","width":267},{"text":"And we can call sbrk to say, \"oh we need some more space\"","width":436},{"text":"So what then are the challenges of actually writing a good malloc?","width":211},{"text":"How are we going to keep track of which parts of our memory have been allocated and which parts are free?","width":499},{"text":"What would you use?","width":271},{"text":"If I said to you right now, \"Okay, start writing a malloc\", how would you keep track of","width":526},{"text":"Say again?","width":131},{"text":"An array of what?","width":476},{"text":"Okay","width":248},{"text":"A disjoint set of regions in memory, okay","width":401},{"text":"Okay, so here's what I'm going to ask you to start with is just a simple linked list","width":340},{"text":"We can start with just a linked list of what's been allocated","width":318},{"text":"And what's been freed","width":192}],
  // Part 5
  [{"text":"So if we go back to our picture that we were drawing","width":555},{"text":"To say 'Oh, look, this has been allocated, this has been freed, this has been allocated, this has been freed.'","width":610},{"text":"What we need is a way to say, 'Okay these are just entries inside a linked list.'","width":688},{"text":"And I can walk along these looking for blocks which are, say, large enough.  And then when I find a block (let's say I'm going to use this one), I need to update my data structure so that I've now got an entry to say 'Hey, this part has now been allocated, and'","width":1644},{"text":"'I've got some remaining space.'","width":476},{"text":"And we go back.  So we can choose to take a block out and turn it into some space and some remaining free space.'","width":527},{"text":"Which of course if that's zero, you don't need to have this entry.","width":835},{"text":"When you call free someone's going to give you a pointer to one of these used areas.  ","width":638},{"text":"And we have to go through our linked list then to update our counting - to say, 'Okay let's turn this now into some free area.'","width":1090},{"text":"Remember how I gave a little advert about coalescing blocks?  Well, our work may not be done because you can imagine that, over here, I've got a free block, and on this side I've got a free block.","width":1127},{"text":"So I now need to update my counting on my linked list to say 'You know what this is now just one giant block if I've got it on both sides, a huge block of free space that can be reused.'","width":1389},{"text":"We could do this really, really inefficiently by having a linked list and then when someone says, 'Oooooh!  Free a pointer.'","width":634},{"text":"I'll just walk through my linked list until I find my entry that corresponds to that pointer.  Oh my gosh, that'd be really slow.  Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll use a hash to speed it up.  I'll have a quick hash so that I can find my pointer and go back to my pointing structure and update my linked list structure correctly.'","width":1519},{"text":"When actually we can do a lot better than that.","width":339},{"text":"We can store our linked list structure as part of the memory that we allocate.","width":689},{"text":"Here's a clever trick.","width":275},{"text":"Let's allocate some memory and we'll allocate a little bit too much.","width":431},{"text":"So if the user says, 'Hey, malloc() 100 bytes we're going to malloc() say 120.'","width":496},{"text":"And we won't tell them, okay?  As far as the caller is concerned, they're just getting 100 bytes.'","width":495},{"text":"But the reason we did this is because we're going to store some secret information back here that's actually our linked list information (our pointer to where to go next).","width":927},{"text":"Wheeeee!","width":421},{"text":"When we return, don't return the pointer to the beginning of here.  No, make sure you bump up the return value so that the return value from your malloc() actually says, 'Okay, user program: here's a little space, here's the 100 bytes that you wanted.'  So we'll add our twenty bytes or however large you made it.","width":1594},{"text":"And when the user later says, 'Okay!  I'm done with my pointer.'  When they call free(), we have to play the other trick and go the other way and say, 'Okay now where did that block REALLY start?'  Let's subtract our 20 bytes again.","width":1045},{"text":"And if we do that, we can find our pointer.  Our linked list structure.","width":315},{"text":"So we're hiding the link information inside the allocation.  Pretty sneaky, huh?","width":663},{"text":"It gets even sneakier than this.","width":288},{"text":"We're going to do two more little things to make it really, really sneaky.","width":323},{"text":"First of all, we'll discover that we actually need to be able to go the other way.  If we start with a block over here, I actually want to be able to kind of have a doubly linked list.  I want to be able to go back to the previous block.","width":1001},{"text":"So not only do I want to store the pointer to the next, I want to store the pointer to the previous.  So I'm going to put that over here.","width":434},{"text":"And I'm also going to actually store this information at the end as well..","width":725},{"text":"So that if I come over here, I can always look at the previous block and say, 'Okay, where are you?  Where's your start?'","width":431},{"text":"The other thing that we can make use of is rather than storing actual addresses (pointers), we can just store numbers.  We can store the number of bytes and then use pointer arithmetic.  If you know that this is 120 bytes long, and we're looking at the beginning here, then we can just add 120.  We can just store 120 as the size of this thing.","width":1502},{"text":"And we can jump to the next entry.","width":260},{"text":"Or if we look back here to the previous value, then actually we're looking back at the previous block.

first","width":498.18181824684143},{"text":"so it zeros the bytes","width":800.1818182468414},{"text":"so you can write a loop to do this","width":228.18181824684143},{"text":"but ill give you a

unlock it","width":895},{"text":"unlocking doesn't take anytime at all","width":118},{"text":"locking usually doesn't take anytime at all unless somebody else has locked the same

twiddle your thumbs","width":461},{"text":"in fact you might actually use up a bit of CPU time while still twiddiling thumbs, it's often called a spin lock","width":415},{"text":"which is how this thing is implemented underneath but we don't need to talk about that","width":230},{"text":"but essentially we've got a little piece of code that says ok, i have to wait i have to wait i have to wait

future","width":468},{"text":"so let's actually have a look at the code for that, how do we do that?","width":207},{"text":"we'll it's part of the pthread library","width":119},{"text":"and we can say I've got a pthread_mutex, here it is, it's a pthread_mutex_t type","width":525},{"text":"and I'll just call it my mutex one","width":360},{"text":"so now we want to lock it","width":182},{"text":"how can I possibly write that code if pthread_mutex_lock()","width":291},{"text":"what do I need to give it? the address of the mutex","width":280},{"text":"and guess how I unlock

that's just lulling us into a false sense of security","width":392},{"text":"the second surprise is that it took a bit longer","width":221},{"text":"so at least I'm sorry I took the loop down by an order of magnitude yet it still took a long time","width":427},{"text":"so this is a not free the lock and unlock are not free, it takes a certain amount of time","width":298},{"text":"especially if you look at how much overhead we're doing in this example","width":186},{"text":"we're just incrementing and getting them out of a loop. so they don't take a small amount of time to run","width":548},{"text":"the second thing is that they may not work if you've forgotten to initialize them","width":280},{"text":"and this time for a lecture demonstration i was unlucky that it did work","width":254},{"text":"what we should do is make sure that our mutex locks are properly initialized","width":338},{"text":"alright, so how can I do that?","width":127},{"text":"well before using them we should call pthread_mutex_init","width":437},{"text":"and let's look at the man page","width":275},{"text":"we can pass in a pointer to our mutex as some attribrutes if we'd like as

example","width":452},{"text":"I also have another group adding subtitles, captions to lecture videos","width":446},{"text":"and are looking at crowdsourcing for that","width":128},{"text":"so lots of good stuff","width":111},{"text":"right so we've talked about that","width":192},{"text":"i'll tell you about some more news in a little bit","width":154},{"text":"right now let's turn our attention to today's little challenge here","width":569},{"text":"the first challenge is relatively easy","width":135},{"text":"but it's still nontrivial","width":128},{"text":"what we're going to do today is make a barrier","width":457},{"text":"so we talked about okay we can create all these threads","width":217},{"text":"and one way to program them would be to say create a whole lot of threads which work on a little problem and join on all of those threads and we wait for them to finish","width":538},{"text":"that's a perfectly reasonable and simple way to use threads","width":192},{"text":"but we can do better","width":119},{"text":"now that we know that we've got these primitives that can stop and wait","width":331},{"text":"we can make our threads wait for each other ","width":244},{"text":"so before going to a part b of an algorithm","width":259},{"text":"let's wait for everybody to finish part a","width":222},{"text":"so this is basically like before closing the door of an elevator and going down to the next part","width":298},{"text":"we want all of our other threads to finish","width":185},{"text":"so that's the idea of a barrier","width":128},{"text":"we can implement this using semaphores and we can say that we're going to look at using condition variables","width":576},{"text":"so remember what is a condition variable? it's nothing particularly special","width":198},{"text":"it just allows our threads to go into a meditative state and not use any cpu until we wake it up","width":400},{"text":"but it's called a condition variable because we've put this inside the loop that tests for some condition","width":712},{"text":"so let's look at our little story here and see what we can do here","width":519},{"text":"there we go","width":193},{"text":"right so I've set up a typical little problem here that hey I've got a lot of data here it is","width":616},{"text":"a big array","width":188},{"text":"it's in global memory so that makes life easy","width":187},{"text":"and I've got a calculation I want to do on it","width":256},{"text":"fortunately I know about threads so I'm going to split my big array up here into chunks","width":680},{"text":"and if I've got two hundred and fifty six blocks why don't I split it up into sixteen chunks","width":917},{"text":"for my oops I'm just looking down here if my x so this is now x and this is now y, nevermind","width":553},{"text":"so my x values are going to be rather than one thread going from zero to two hundred and fifty five","width":648},{"text":"I'm going to get each thread to work independently on a segment of this matrix","width":477},{"text":"alright so if we have a look at this ","width":192},{"text":"this is what we've got here","width":108},{"text":"in my main I'm going to fire off N threads","width":385},{"text":"okay so we'll define N to be say sixteen","width":410},{"text":"wouldn't it be nice to have a sixteen core processor","width":160},{"text":"well you too can right now either just spend a lot of money or wait three years and it'll be easy","width":539},{"text":"so it'll be cheap","width":51},{"text":"so then we'll start say 16 threads","width":271},{"text":"I want to ask each one of them to do a chunk of the work","width":165},{"text":"one sixteenth of the total amount of work","width":302},{"text":"okay so great we've called pthread_create","width":340},{"text":"what's the first argument we pass into pthread_create?","width":430},{"text":"yes we are actually going to pass in the address of that","width":253},{"text":"the address of where we want pthread_create to store the the thread identifier","width":297},{"text":"so how do I write that","width":105},{"text":"I could say ampersand okay here's my little array and I want the i one","width":477},{"text":"that's probably the most readable way of writing that","width":192},{"text":"an equivalent would be to say ids + i","width":438},{"text":"is that true? so think about that or test it","width":1066},{"text":"part of it becomes what's the size of this","width":154},{"text":"what happens when you add to it","width":193},{"text":"I'm not going to write that today","width":84},{"text":"I'm going to go with this","width":69},{"text":"right so we've got the address of where we want to store that identifier","width":385},{"text":"we don't need to set any special parameters for our pthread_create","width":174},{"text":"we're going to pass in this calc function that actually does all the work for us and finally we say (void*) i","width":361},{"text":"right so what are we doing here we're taking that little integer and we're turning it into a pointer","width":320},{"text":"you can that in C, remember it's just a bit pattern being converted into a similar bit pattern but we're saying that the type of it should be treated as a (void *) pointer","width":704},{"text":"why do I that, that's because that's the argument type","width":192},{"text":"and that will be okay provided we don't actually try to follow that pointer into memory","width":320},{"text":"remember it's just a value 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15","width":320},{"text":"okay so at the end of here I'm going to wait for my threads to finish","width":355},{"text":"okay so here I'm just going to call pthread_join and this time pass in the value of my little identifiers","width":623},{"text":"and I don't actually care about the exit value","width":287},{"text":"otherwise I could have passed in a pointer to a void * to grab that","width":294},{"text":"and then I would write some code to print out the result which I don't care about","width":192},{"text":"so that's the outside of my algorithm, start all these threads, off you go, sixteen people start doing your work","width":389},{"text":"I'm going to give each one of you a unique number and then wait for them to all finish by calling pthread_join","width":585},{"text":"now the main part of this puzzle starts","width":172},{"text":"okay we're going to write our little calc program","width":300},{"text":"we know that our pthread functions take a void* and return a void*","width":827},{"text":"so I've got some pointer, I don't actually want to use that variable as a pointer though","width":275},{"text":"I just want to cast it back into an integer","width":466},{"text":"so no memory lookups were used in this casting ","width":221},{"text":"it simply says hey I know you treat me as a pointer, I lied I just want to treat it as an integer","width":384},{"text":"and I went through those hoops just to make the compiler happy","width":421},{"text":"and I'm confident that a void* pointer can hold the integer between zero and fifteen","width":294},{"text":"right so that's going to be my starting point","width":169},{"text":"my end point exclusive would just be the starting point plus sixteen","width":295},{"text":"so now in my little loop x can go form the start almost to the end and my y is going to go through all of the remaining 8192 entries","width":772},{"text":"right and then I do my calculation","width":128},{"text":"that's going to take a while","width":84},{"text":"now you might say really all sixteen threads are going to run at the same time so they are all going to finish at the same time","width":407},{"text":"well that's not quite true","width":222},{"text":"it could be that one of these threads starts very very late","width":312},{"text":"it could be another thread starts completely earlier ","width":128},{"text":"it depends on how the operating system decides to schedule these threads","width":221},{"text":"it could be that a cpu is temporarily stolen to do some other work","width":280},{"text":"like process an interrupt because you pressed something on the keyboard","width":179},{"text":"something arrived on the network","width":105},{"text":"something arrived from the disk","width":75},{"text":"so you're not guaranteed to have the CPU for 100% of the time","width":265},{"text":"so we're not quite sure when all of these threads are going to finish","width":204},{"text":"so that's where we come in now","width":85},{"text":"we're going to try and write some code in here so that we can make sure that we don't continue the second calculation until all sixteen threads have finished","width":798},{"text":"so what are you going to do","width":153},{"text":"how are we going to solve this?","width":199},{"text":"what do we need?","width":442},{"text":"I need some ideas","width":318},{"text":"we could potentially do this with a semaphore","width":175},{"text":"kind of, what other ways could we do this though?","width":556},{"text":"okay yes we need some sort of global count variable","width":146},{"text":"just keep track of how many threads are currently running","width":269},{"text":"we're not going to try and directly query these threads","width":222},{"text":"we'll just have some sort of global variable that all the threads can decrement to say oh yeah I finished","width":668},{"text":"okay so up here we'll have an int remain and we can set that equal to sixteen","width":587},{"text":"or N if we want to","width":498},{"text":"so when I actually finish my work, each thread will decrement remain","width":950},{"text":"now notice what I just said","width":44},{"text":"when each thread finishes, it is going to decrement remain","width":161},{"text":"at this point, alarm bells should go off","width":328},{"text":"okay very quiet ones inside your head","width":192},{"text":"because I've just said that more than one thread is touching a data structure","width":320},{"text":"so there's a potential race condition","width":143},{"text":"two threads might decide to decrement remain at the same time","width":185},{"text":"whoops we don't want that","width":78},{"text":"we want each thread to have exclusive access to this remain","width":260},{"text":"when it's actually manipulating that","width":105},{"text":"so how do we ensure that happens","width":152},{"text":"yes bring out your mutex lock","width":456},{"text":"maybe it looks like a giant padlock or anyways nevermind","width":347},{"text":"so yeah we'll call pthread_mutex_lock on our mutex","width":640},{"text":"okay so this takes a pointer to that data structure","width":326},{"text":"at this point alarm bells go off and say oh hey did I actually remember to initialize the mutex","width":334},{"text":"and the answer is yes yeah you did if you actually managed to write the correct function","width":382},{"text":"these are pthread_mutex_init is one way to initialize your mutex lock","width":308},{"text":"right so if we do a lock, we know that any other thread that comes in here has to wait","width":459},{"text":"it could be then that those other threads that have not yet finished","width":490},{"text":"in which case the thread that is running this code ","width":169},{"text":"we want it to go to sleep","width":77},{"text":"okay well let's suppose I didn't know about condition variables","width":356},{"text":"then I might say something like while remain is greater than zero","width":504},{"text":"do nothing","width":250},{"text":"wohahahahaha we laugh at that code wohaahaha","width":171},{"text":"why? because we do know about condition variables, but why else?","width":501},{"text":"yeah the first thread that gets in there is just going to spin around","width":448},{"text":"and round and round and round it goes","width":145},{"text":"the second thread when it finishes will attempt to lock the mutex","width":289},{"text":"are you prepared to wait? yes i'm prepared to wait","width":171},{"text":"right then the second thread that finishes will get stuck inside pthread_mutex_lock","width":248},{"text":"waiting to lock that mutex, but we can see from this code that that mutex lock is never unlocked","width":313},{"text":"the second, third, fourth and fifth and the remaining fifteen threads will never get past pthread_mutex_lock","width":455},{"text":"because that mutex lock is never unlocked wohahahah","width":232},{"text":"alright so how can we start fixing this code","width":322},{"text":"well here's what we are going to do","width":79},{"text":"rather than just having a busy loop where we continuously burn up CPU time","width":298},{"text":"we are going to call pthread_condition_wait","width":561},{"text":"and for that you pass in your condition variable and pass in a pointer to your mutex lock","width":494},{"text":"and every good systems programmer knows that is when your thread meditates","width":410},{"text":"it goes to sleep","width":255},{"text":"but before it goes to sleep what happens?","width":310},{"text":"what do you get inside here?","width":194},{"text":"for free, what's it do for you?","width":207},{"text":"hint, we have to pass in the pointer to the mutex","width":166},{"text":"why? because it's going to unlock that mutex for you","width":287},{"text":"and then go to sleep","width":192},{"text":"alright so one of our threads arrived here early and said \"look remain is still non zero, I'm just going to sit here and chillax\"","width":783},{"text":"yeah i'm not going to do anything, I'm just going to go into my meditative state","width":384},{"text":"the very last thread, the sixteenth thread that comes in says \"oh look remain is finally zero, I don't need to sleep, I can continue!\"","width":835},{"text":"so I'll unlock and off we go","width":298},{"text":"and the sixteenth thread to arrive will then do the second calculation","width":347},{"text":"right so that's not a very good barrier right?","width":436},{"text":"what do we do? we wait until the sixteenth sheep finally arrives that was enough weight to tip the balance and the sixteenth sheep could continue","width":576},{"text":"and all the others are left there waiting, sleeping, yes?","width":319},{"text":"we'd like a way to wake up those meditating threads","width":354},{"text":"how do we do that?","width":214},{"text":"yes broadcast, we want to not just wake up one sleeping thread with a little bell, ding","width":615},{"text":"right, if you call pthread_condition_signal the system will choose one arbitrary sleeping thread and wake it up","width":713},{"text":"we don't want to do that, we want to wake up everybody","width":300},{"text":"so this is like running over to FARPAR and shouting free ice cream right? everybody comes over","width":545},{"text":"actually any free food at FARPAR will work but so","width":244},{"text":"how can we do this? well here's what we'll do","width":263},{"text":"inside our code, we need to call broadcast","width":346},{"text":"now I could do it even before the while loop here","width":371},{"text":"I could say \"okay pthread_condition_broadcast\" and here's the way we're going to wake up, anybody who is sleeping on this particular conditional variable","width":993},{"text":"now will this work? yes, here's what happens","width":297},{"text":"you wake up everybody in FARPAR and they check and discover that actually there is no ice cream so they just go back to sleep","width":530},{"text":"okay so that's a silly analogy, but what happens in the code is that we wake up everybody inside the condition wait and see look we wrote it inside a while loop","width":544},{"text":"so everybody wakes up, eventually they get to run on the CPU, and when they do they'll say \"oh look remain is actually still greater than zero\"","width":555},{"text":"so this code will keep waking up every time a thread gets to this point, it would run it","width":301},{"text":"so we could do a bit better than that","width":111},{"text":"we actually don't want to always wake people, we actually only want to call this when we know that if remain is now zero, actually bother to wake people up","width":1244},{"text":"alright so if I'm the last person in the gate, wake everybody up","width":271},{"text":"there's no point in waking other people up beforehand because they will simply check and discover that remain is actually still non zero and then just go back to sleep","width":601},{"text":"so that would work, it's just not that efficient","width":250},{"text":"this is more efficient, don't wake people up until remain is zero","width":575},{"text":"so that is a barrier, yes at the back?","width":809},{"text":"well the last thread will see the value of zero so you'll never actually go into this while loop","width":297},{"text":"yes I could have written it afterwards, it's still a good idea to do the broadcast inside the lock and unlock","width":643},{"text":"there's a subtle race condition we can get if we don't","width":373},{"text":"right and the other thing to remember is that condition wait actually does three things","width":369},{"text":"after being woken up from its deep sleep, before it returns, it waits to acquire the mutex lock again","width":635},{"text":"so that means you've woken people up but they won't actually start to execute this code","width":349},{"text":"they won't be checking the remain value until someone exits","width":326},{"text":"until someone unlocks the mutex","width":191},{"text":"so in this case the sixteenth thread will come in, see that remain is now zero, wake everyone up","width":322},{"text":"but now they've woken up but can't actually continue on this code yet because we're still holding the mutex lock","width":510},{"text":"so eventually we unlock and then another thread in here will say great!","width":257},{"text":"finally I've woken up and finally I've managed to lock the mutex thread and I can continue","width":266},{"text":"and what's it do? it just unlocks the mutex and continues","width":203},{"text":"and so on and so on for the remaining threads","width":265},{"text":"so this is really really powerful","width":128},{"text":"this is a very very powerful paradigm now because now you can make your threads do a whole lot of work, pause for each other, wait for each other and then continue to do more work, etc","width":575},{"text":"now you can write pretty good performant code in a way that you couldn't before","width":481},{"text":"okay any other questions?","width":173},{"text":"I'll give you a hint, I like to do things like show you code and say on an exam or quiz and say \"well okay does this actually work? is it efficient or not? or when might it break?\"","width":906},{"text":"so you could imagine for example if we only did signal here instead of broadcast, we'd only be waking up one thread","width":479},{"text":"and the other fourteen of them would still be sleeping","width":561},{"text":"aha right so when we come to test this, A will be compiled so let's fix what you said","width":581},{"text":"pthread_cond_t there we go and then when we come to test it, it doesn't work","width":611},{"text":"what did we forget to do?","width":128},{"text":"initialize it, yes! remember with these things, we've actually got two steps","width":343},{"text":"you've got to A. make some memory somewhere of enough size and B. actually call init on it","width":414},{"text":"so inside here we need to do pthread_cond_init and if we were writing robust code, that's a null as well, we would check the return values of these","width":1555}],

here's a memory allocator that we did not talk about in lecture","width":332},{"text":"but rather than making allocations the size that the user requests, we can have chunks which are 2^n sizes","width":972},{"text":"so if I have a pool of a 1024 bytes, we can split that into two allocations of 512, for example","width":657},{"text":"or I can split this 512 into two allocations of 256","width":341},{"text":"so if I keep my chunks at sizes 2^n","width":354},{"text":"then I can very quickly and efficiently find an allocation of the correct size","width":636},{"text":"so, for example, if I wanted 65 byte allocations, I would end up using allocations of 128 bytes","width":899},{"text":"and so, if I had 1024 bytes to play with, I could make eight of those allocations","width":375},{"text":"so you can see that this kind of allocator, which by the way is called the buddy allocator, suffers strongly from fragmentation","width":651},{"text":"I'm going to give you a block of 128 bytes, but you're only going to use 65 bytes of it","width":563},{"text":"so it can end up having a great bit of a unnecessary space, but the good news is that it's very very fast to find a free block of sufficient size","width":956},{"text":"implicit and explicit free lists? you've seen this now in the MP contest that we can have a separate list of free blocks","width":659},{"text":"so it's much much quicker to find a free block rather than scanning through a linked list of all free and allocated blocks, why not have a second linked list which only contains the free entries?","width":1038},{"text":"so that's an explicit free list","width":141},{"text":"and if we do that, we can put it inside the unused space","width":664},{"text":"okay so you know about first fit and worst fit and how they work","width":484},{"text":"and you know what malloc() and calloc() do if they can't return the request.","width":306},{"text":"alright good, I have a moment left","width":254},{"text":"good news and bad news.

YES!","width":151},{"text":"we need to actually go back to main memory and say \"okay I'm tying to read this particular address\"","width":377},{"text":"so, I need to turn this into a page number and offset and once ive got the page number, i'll go back to my table, lookup table, which is stored in real memory in order to pull out the actual physical frame","width":954},{"text":"and so this might be pointing anywhere. okay its actually in here","width":432},{"text":"so it took me two memory reads, i had to read the 32 bits in here, and then finally, the byte that i cared about","width":711},{"text":"what have i just done to my machine?!","width":201},{"text":"I've just through sheer brilliance managed to make it twice as slow!

  // Part 3
  [{"text":"Okay.

Alright, the number of bytes read was zero.","width":565},{"text":"Why?","width":339},{"text":"Yes! It's still at the end! Whoops. ","width":153},{"text":"Okay. So before we read in the entire file, let's seek back to the beginning. Alright, so how can I do that?","width":493},{"text":"I could do this two different ways.","width":152},{"text":"We could specify an absolute position 0.","width":348},{"text":"So I could call SeekSet. Okay, let's do that. Where is my..there it is.","width":871},{"text":"Or I could do relative to the current position. So if I know that I'm 71 bytes ahead. I could say move negative 71 bytes backwards. Alright, this time how many bytes we got?","width":685},{"text":"What? 1?","width":163},{"text":"Oh I must have messed up the constants here. Number of bytes read...","width":784},{"text":"Uh.. bop ba bop ba doo. Alright.","width":524},{"text":"Or we may have to read the... Oh no no no no no. That's correct.","width":479},{"text":"I did this wrong way around. Okay. Here we go.","width":304},{"text":"So, I specify this as \"Hey read 1 chunk and that chunk size is position.\"","width":363},{"text":"So now if I set my fread constants correctly, it would say the size of chunk is 1 and I want to read 71 of them. In other words 71 characters.","width":625},{"text":"Then the result I get is correct! I managed to read 71 characters.","width":341},{"text":"So great, I read the entire file into memory in one go. And we could print it out.","width":450},{"text":"So let's just puts. Where is the buffer? Okay. Buffer.","width":711},{"text":"Now is this safe code? Do you trust it?","width":391},{"text":"Look, it printed out the contents of that file. Printed out Hello world. ","width":332},{"text":"Is that safe?","width":285},{"text":"Correct! There is no null pointer guarantee at the end.","width":211},{"text":"So actually we should have made the buffer one byte larger and then actually put a zero byte in at the very end.","width":673},{"text":"So, safer code would just say \"Look, I know the file is there, so I'm gonna treat it like text later.\"","width":356},{"text":"But fread is just saying, okay read all the bytes into this memory. If I truly wanted to treat it as a single string, c-string. I better make sure that it is terminated at the end.","width":886},{"text":"So my code might have to be put at the buffer.. There we go.. Make sure that truly is terminated.","width":975},{"text":"Alright, so now we got a fast way to read in the entire file.","width":488},{"text":"Yes! ","width":492},{"text":"Here?","width":199},{"text":"fseek here?","width":259},{"text":"Okay, so this means the very end. Past the end of the file.","width":325},{"text":"So if you would to then open this as reading and writing, you would actually being appending to the current contents of the file.","width":509},{"text":"Yes?","width":645},{"text":"Okay. So.. does the a typical text ... does a typical text have a null characters in it?","width":537},{"text":"No they don't. It's only when we pull strings into memory when we append a null character to represent the c-string.","width":655},{"text":"But files don't have the null characters in them.","width":134},{"text":"Sorry, the text files don't normally have a null characters in them.","width":315},{"text":"No. It does not have an end of file character.","width":173},{"text":"So, instead there's some meta information to say, \"Oh actually this file is currently have this many bytes.\"","width":452},{"text":"And there is going to be an alternative ..so the meta information we will see about the file is the thing would be something like when was it modified? Who modified it?","width":419},{"text":"Who created the file, and how many bytes on disk does it currently use.","width":805},{"text":"Right. So the fseek does not actually walk along the file checking for the byte. It can quickly use the meta information of the file to tell how big the file is. So it's pretty fast.","width":757},{"text":"Yes?","width":449},{"text":"Would there be what?","width":490},{"text":"Yeah. There's actually is something call stat. But we will talk about it later.","width":342},{"text":"Yes. So the alternative way to get the file length is to use stat.","width":217},{"text":"But I'm using the fseek, ftell as a way to introduce fseek and ftell as \"Hey here is one practical way of using it.","width":620},{"text":"And stat is low level system call. If we use fseek and ftell, you are using a c-library and nice thing about that is that it is little bit more portable then getting straight down into the POSIX.","width":954},{"text":"land of using stat.","width":340},{"text":"Okay, for example, this would work on a windows machine.","width":456},{"text":"One gotcha is that you saw is that fseek gave you a long.","width":433},{"text":"So this would only work on medium sized files. These days we can have files that are gigantic.","width":545},{"text":"And much larger can be represented than just a long type.","width":325},{"text":"Yes?","width":534},{"text":"Right, so if you fseek back to the beginning, you can set it up so you can only write over specific bytes.","width":691},{"text":"So the trick here is the option we give to fopen. As so whether you want it to start brand new file or append to an existing file.","width":799},{"text":"But the way to think about this is simply that my file is basically just an array on disk.","width":594},{"text":"And I've got a pointer that points to where I would write some bytes. So if I wrote 3 bytes, I'm going to just overwrite 3 bytes.","width":636}],
  // Part 4
  [{"text":"Other questions?","width":546},{"text":"So... Interesting problem happens is. What happens if we open these file descriptors and then we fork?","width":893},{"text":"What happens, right? Cause I've got clearly something opened, talking to a file.","width":344},{"text":"So I can now modify that. I can fseek to different places","width":398},{"text":"And I can close it.","width":372},{"text":"Okay, so. First the little problem is let's suppose your parent calls fclose.","width":1152},{"text":"What do you think will happen to the child?","width":228},{"text":"Can a child still use the file descriptor?","width":182},{"text":"Make your guess now, and you want to be sociable, tell your neighbor","width":877},{"text":"Okay, here is why I told to tell your neighbor, because psychology has shown that you'll actually remember things more if you're surprised when you are wrong.","width":539},{"text":"Okay, so make a commitment. It doesn't matter if you get wrong. Just at least be surprise. Okay.","width":380},{"text":"Alright, so the answer is that it doesn't affect the child.","width":364},{"text":"That these actually appeared to be independent, so actually if the parent closes, the child can continue to use the file descriptor and vice versa.","width":859},{"text":"Alright, so, in that sense they are independent.","width":432},{"text":"Alright, now what about this one? ","width":143},{"text":"What happens if you fseek before forking?","width":314},{"text":"What do you think the child and parent see? Do they see the same position?","width":439},{"text":"Make your guess now.","width":2198},{"text":"Okay, so if you seek and then fork, both the child and parent will start from that position","width":389},{"text":"So for example, if you seek to the very end of the file, and then forked. Both the child and the parent start from that position.","width":570},{"text":"So, they will both see or use the new position.","width":883},{"text":"Okay, what about this one?","width":113},{"text":"What happens if say the parent or the child fseeks?","width":452},{"text":"Does it affect the other process?","width":296},{"text":"Make your guess now","width":1592},{"text":"Right.","width":354},{"text":"Yes, it affects the other process","width":699},{"text":"Okay, hey, that's not fair, is it?","width":184},{"text":"Alright, so here's why.","width":153},{"text":"Let's think about this from the system's perspective.","width":268},{"text":"It's got a big list of file descriptors which are opened, and if you fork, then actually it increase reference counter and says \"Oh look, I've actual got two processes using my internal file descriptor.","width":1124},{"text":"So it's a bit like showing a library book with somebody that if you want to turn the page of the library book, guess what everybody else using the same file descriptor has to look at that page of the book.","width":917},{"text":"Alright, so the analogy is like a book page.","width":658},{"text":"Okay, so the surprise is, \"Yes\", in terms of closing it, it's independent, but in terms of using it, \"No.\" It's actual one open reference. ","width":598},{"text":"So, think of it as the kernel holding a reference to a file at a particular position.","width":411},{"text":"And by forking, all you've done is double the number of, or increment it by 1 of number of processes using this same open resource.","width":779},{"text":"That means the parent could play bad news on a child.","width":193},{"text":"Here you go. Have this file descriptor. Oh ha ha. I'm going to change the position that you are looking at and you didn't know.","width":415},{"text":"Alright, so you can really mess with child's mind here.","width":273},{"text":"So it's like a book. There is one particular position, so that's a common gotcha. ","width":558},{"text":"And thus. Here's something that is kind of useful. If you wanted to write code to write to different parts of a file, at different positions.","width":1207},{"text":"Then, if you had multiple threads, then there is a problem, right?","width":365},{"text":"all of them would be calling fseek trying to move to a different position.","width":326},{"text":"It would be nice if you can just say, \"No, no. I want to send some bytes and this is the absolute position in the file that I want to send these bytes.","width":431},{"text":"And so, this is why high performance code these days. If you go to the HPC. HPC lands high performance computing stuff.","width":528},{"text":"They often use something call pwrite, which allows you to specifically write to a certain position in the file independently of this fseek and ftell stuff.","width":711},{"text":"I don't think we'll use it inside cs 241. I just want it to mention it. It is just like a cute thing to talk about in an interview.","width":380},{"text":"It's like, \"Oh yeah by the way, this pwrite stuff exists\"","width":232},{"text":"That came about because of changing the position of the file becomes the bottle neck.","width":449},{"text":"That all of your threads or child processes suddenly say, \"Okay, hands off everybody. I want to change the absolute position of the file and no one else can change it once I'm using it\" So that's clearly a course of contention","width":764}],

It seems to exist on the file system, and in fact the joy of using a bag pipe like this is that it's lifetime is independent of your process.","width":732},{"text":"The bag pipe will live for other processes","width":344},{"text":"And you can create it using this make fifo. ","width":217},{"text":"What do you think fifo stands for?","width":196},{"text":"First In First Out, right. So your first breadth into the bag pipe will be the first data that comes out when you try to read from this file.","width":533},{"text":"Except this is not a file. It's a pipe, so the order of the data.","width":335},{"text":"So reading from it and the writing of it doesn't behave like a file. It's like a queue. First-in First-out queue.","width":594},{"text":"They are not often use, but they are worth knowing about","width":467},{"text":"Remember signals? I'm not talking about con-sig. I'm talking about software interrupts we can do such as sigchild, sigint, sigkill.","width":610},{"text":"Pipes themselves have a signal","width":414},{"text":"Alright. You get a signal","width":1400},{"text":"If you send data down the pipe and no one is listening","width":524},{"text":"See, if a tree falls in a forest, does anybody hear it?","width":325},{"text":"As the writer, how can you discover that your reader has died?","width":323},{"text":"Is no longer listening to the data","width":135},{"text":"And here's how.","width":91},{"text":"Actually, you can get a software interrupt, you can get the signal.","width":208},{"text":"Say, Oh by the way, there is no one listening anymore. All the file descriptors have disappeared, have been closed.","width":696},{"text":"Maybe deliberately, or maybe the child process itself has finished, but guess what? You can send as much data we used, because you'll like try down this pipe, but there is no one there to read it anymore.","width":949},{"text":"So you get a sigpipe, so you can choose to handle that. You can set up a signal handler to say, \"Oh look, my reader from the pipe is not getting anymore data\"","width":834},{"text":"Now, a couple of comments on this.","width":445},{"text":"First of all, this means if you fork, then make sure you close the unwanted file descriptors","width":1378},{"text":"So what do I mean by that?","width":460},{"text":"Remember we did this kind of thing, we said \"Okay, give me two of these\", we call pipe. ","width":347},{"text":"Look how easy this is. Alright, so now I got my read and my write. Then I call fork","width":557},{"text":"So now, conceptually, we got four file descriptors. Yes, the child has two, the parent has two.","width":404},{"text":"But we're only going to use half of them.","width":250},{"text":"If the parent gonna do the writing, the parent does not need the read.","width":192},{"text":"If the child is gonna do the reading, it doesn't need the writing file descriptor.","width":397},{"text":"So a common pattern of this is in the child, the first thing you do is that you would close the one that you're not gonna use.","width":802},{"text":"So for example, we might close the second one, and in the parent, we do the same thing. ","width":789},{"text":"We close the first one, the read.","width":495}],
  // Part 6
  [{"text":"Why'd do that?","width":206},{"text":"To make sure that when our true reader really does finish or close their file descriptor then we'll get the signal.","width":584},{"text":"Then the system truly knows that there can be no more, that there is no one left to actually hear the message.","width":391},{"text":"Right? So that's the pattern. you'll see this, and you can read the wiki book to see examples of this, where you close the unwanted one.","width":548},{"text":"Okay, now the joke of the day and on EWS it doesn't work.","width":406},{"text":"The EWS linux kernel 2.6 whatever it is, has a bug such that you never see sigpipe. ","width":708},{"text":"But don't worry. I'll tell you a work-around on Friday. ","width":331},{"text":"Or maybe the end of today, we'll see","width":242},{"text":"Right, should we have time for this?Alright, how do we send an integer... a value of a variable?","width":379},{"text":"Okay. I showed you code that just use read and write to send stuff down to a pipe.","width":481},{"text":"If you wanna start sending more interesting data like integers, etc, we want to be able to call things like fprintf(), right?","width":454},{"text":"We actually want to send.. a user send a c-library.","width":190},{"text":"Guess what? Here's something very useful. I can call fdopen.","width":777},{"text":"Where it pass in one of my integers, a file descriptor","width":325},{"text":"So, for example, if I want to use the write end, and then the other is... I'm not trying to use this for reading or writing.","width":652},{"text":"And this gives me back one of the file objects.","width":432},{"text":"There, I can then call fprintf().","width":204},{"text":"Or if I'd opened the reading one, I can then call fscanf()","width":465},{"text":"So this is a way to promote a low level unix file descriptor up to a c-based object that we can now... I don't mean object in C++. ","width":745},{"text":"I just mean a resource in a system so then we can call fprintf or fscanf and work with more structured data.","width":749},{"text":"So this takes us from a simple integer to the C-based version. Now I can use fscanf and fprintf.","width":836},{"text":"Questions? Yes?","width":272},{"text":"Yeah fdopen.","width":151},{"text":"Alright so we're going from an integer to a C-level object","width":479},{"text":"Alright, yes?","width":433},{"text":"When it happens, it happens when you try to write stuff in into the pipe no one is listening.","width":475},{"text":"So you want to try to write some data and then you just discovered that no one's listening.","width":839},{"text":"You don't what happens to the reader. That's the point. Maybe you could set up a different pipe to say \"Okay, I'm gonna finish it, you can use another pipe to send the data.\"","width":717},{"text":"But the idea is that the pipe itself can tell you when no one is listening.","width":546},{"text":"No. no, it's when you try to send the data itself. If there is no one there already, you get the signal.","width":1035},{"text":"Okay, so.. right. Yes we have a quiz on wednesday. I'll publish some practice questions in a little bit. But here are the topics you can expect.","width":875},{"text":"Conditional variables, semaphore, mutex locks. You have mastery of these amazing tools. You know what producer consumer is.","width":591},{"text":"You know how to make a fixed size multi-threaded ring buffer.","width":246},{"text":"You could do it with semaphores, you can do it with conditional variables. You know how to analyze a good and bad implementations.","width":587},{"text":"You know the coffman conditions. You could understand the definition. You know reader-writer.","width":469},{"text":"You could analyze good and bad implementations.","width":244},{"text":"You know dining philosophers.","width":175},{"text":"You could talk about the different implementations and will they suffer from deadlock or livelock.","width":321},{"text":"And finally, resource allocation graphs and how to use them to determine which processes are deadlocked.","width":533},{"text":"With that have a wonderful week, and I'll see you on Wednesday.

system calls","width":273.18181824684143},{"text":"and then we're going to talk about some fun stuff, we're going to start talking about networking","width":259.18181824684143},{"text":"and this is kind of important right?","width":83.18181824684143},{"text":"we want our machines to talk to each other so we'll get done today with some of the basics about ip4 and what's the difference between UDP and TCP","width":654.1818182468414},{"text":"but before we do all of that, let's see if your brain cells are working today in terms of pipes","width":367.18181824684143},{"text":"right so I mentioned before that you can get a SIGPIPE when something happens - when?","width":659.1818182468414},{"text":"when does your process get a SIGPIPE?","width":410.18181824684143},{"text":"I'm sorry I'm not listening","width":144.18181824684143},{"text":"yes, when you have a PIPE and you write some bytes to the pipe and there's no one there to listen","width":508.18181824684143},{"text":"and the failure [will cause your process to] get a SIGPIPE so you can write some code inside your signal handlers to say oh look the listeners died, maybe I'll just fork exec a new one for example","width":686.1818182468414},{"text":"now a common gotcha though is when your playing with pipes and fork as you might have found out in the lab, is that you forget to close all of those file handles that you don't need","width":618.1818182468414},{"text":"so if you still happen to have a reading file descriptor open, you won't get the signal because in theory you could still read form that","width":698.1818182468414},{"text":"okay, so that's our first little question right","width":428.18181824684143},{"text":"alright so when all the readers have closed and you try to write to a pipe, you should get a signal","width":1093.1818182468414},{"text":"in practice we've found it doesn't actually work on EWS","width":218.18181824684143},{"text":"the old EWS machines don't support

that's my new email script","width":156.18181824684143},{"text":"I can now send email as anybody to anybody inside UIUC","width":469.18181824684143},{"text":"anyway I won't make jobs about the

this machine","width":273.18181824684143},{"text":"but it is important because hey with this box you've got root","width":195.18181824684143},{"text":"you can do root-y things like mount file systems, like connect to named ports and run them ports","width":415.18181824684143},{"text":"we'll be talking about that in a little bit","width":134.18181824684143},{"text":"but anyways, so let's finish our pipes off","width":146.18181824684143},{"text":"so when can a listener discover that there are no more writers","width":237.18181824684143},{"text":"how about this then, because in section our listener right was wc, we were using word count to pull data from standard in","width":625.1818182468414},{"text":"how do you think wc knew that the pipe had closed, that there was no more bytes coming","width":730.1818182468414},{"text":"okay so we had to flush it but actually we had to do more than flush","width":189.18181824684143},{"text":"flush simply says to the C library hey you know those bytes you're looking after for performance sake","width":334.18181824684143},{"text":"I don't want you to look after them anymore","width":96.18181824684143},{"text":"send them down the pipe, in other words call write","width":227.18181824684143},{"text":"but we need to do more than that because flushing doesn't actually mean that the pipe itself has closed","width":369.18181824684143},{"text":"we want to close it but we haven't actually answered the question yet of how does the listener know when it's not going to get anymore bytes","width":724.1818182468414},{"text":"and the answer is if you call read, it returns zero","width":512.1818182468414},{"text":"so it's not an error yet, it's just simply that hey I'm going to give you zero bytes and the pipe is closed","width":736.1818182468414},{"text":"so let's do this","width":243.18181824684143},{"text":"let's have a little play","width":207.18181824684143},{"text":"okie dokie right so I made a pipe ","width":279.18181824684143},{"text":"I'm going to close the second file descriptor, in other words the write end","width":283.18181824684143},{"text":"and let's try reading from it","width":204.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so bytes read equals read","width":216.18181824684143},{"text":"we need to give it a file descriptor okay so what shall I say","width":270.18181824684143},{"text":"fd[0] is where we read from, how many bytes do we want? well here's a pointer to buffer and I'll take sizeof buffer minus one","width":582.1818182468414},{"text":"why minus one you say? well for safety for example I might put in at the very end a termination byte","width":583.1818182468414},{"text":"for example, just to make sure my strings don't go on forever","width":236.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so let's print out to see what value we get","width":277.18181824684143},{"text":"okay and I want to print out the result of my read call","width":844.1818182468414},{"text":"hey and look it's true, we do get zero, fantastic okay go away","width":333.18181824684143},{"text":"right so that's one way right? now that's obviously if we're doing the low level calls like read and write","width":515.1818182468414},{"text":"if your working at the C library level","width":349.18181824684143},{"text":"you can check for an end of file EOF condition on that pointer","width":744.1818182468414},{"text":"so remember how we do fdopen to get yourself a C library pointer","width":261.18181824684143},{"text":"well then there's a thing called fopen","width":256.18181824684143},{"text":"right so that's relatively easy then to discover that something is closed","width":306.18181824684143},{"text":"another way of doing it of course is that you come up with a special token or special character to say hey if I send them asterisks or a zero bytes, then I know that that signifies to me that there's no more bytes coming","width":745.1818182468414},{"text":"another way is to say at the beginning of your message, hey I'm going to send exactly 4000 bytes and here they come","width":402.18181824684143},{"text":"another way is to know exactly how many bytes you are going to send beforehand anyway and hard code it into your program","width":437.18181824684143},{"text":"so that's all we're going to say about pipes today","width":313.18181824684143},{"text":"let's mess up our program, let's try and read from a file descriptor that doesn't exist","width":363.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so let's say from one hundred and twenty three","width":167.18181824684143},{"text":"okay I don't need this right, so what's going to happen now?","width":680.1818182468414},{"text":"alright we get a result of negative one","width":171.18181824684143},{"text":"the read failed, I cannot read from file descriptor 123","width":259.18181824684143},{"text":"well you and I know that's because there's nothing connected to that integer","width":240.18181824684143},{"text":"it's an invalid file descriptor","width":156.18181824684143},{"text":"but we want to actually know more than that, we want to know something about what went wrong","width":409.18181824684143},{"text":"and for that there's actually this global constant called, whoops come back thank you, errno","width":750.1818182468414},{"text":"right error number, so error number will have been set","width":265.18181824684143},{"text":"so let's find out what value it was ","width":230.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so we'll stick this in here and we'll print it

here we said about we are configuring it","width":414},{"text":"um we could get address info","width":146},{"text":"to setup the real struct for us","width":231},{"text":"and then we can use it so now here's the um","width":276},{"text":"here's the main part","width":188},{"text":"write a socket","width":264},{"text":"call connect","width":197},{"text":"so in a sense","width":164},{"text":"making a client actually requires two calls","width":203},{"text":"get a socket and ask that socket to connect to something","width":145},{"text":"that's not quite true because we are using this getaddressinfo to help us make the connect call","width":399},{"text":"but this is the actual part, if we actually know exactly what we wanted to put","width":253},{"text":"set it to connect, we won't need to be calling getaddressinfo","width":200},{"text":"that's just a helper method for us","width":164},{"text":"actually it's just these two calls: hey i want a socket, and hey please connect to somewhere. please connect to BBC and here's the IP address. right","width":619},{"text":"alright so um","width":209},{"text":"last semester","width":115},{"text":"no, last lecture","width":156},{"text":"i lied to you","width":131},{"text":"just a little bit","width":144},{"text":"i said getaddressinfo returns a struct of these addressinfo objects. well that's kind of true","width":865},{"text":"actually, it returns a linkedlist of them","width":301},{"text":"so here's what happens, you say, look, in my hints","width":205},{"text":"i would like a certain kind of connection, like, i would like, say, IP 4, for example","width":558},{"text":"and i would like, say, a stream based port for, say, TCP","width":409},{"text":"getaddressinfo says, okay you wanna get this remote host, i will find all of the possible ways","width":397},{"text":"to set up a socket and connect to the remote host and return it to you","width":312},{"text":"and that's what we get, we get a whole lot of these addrinfoes","width":215},{"text":"now and for our little code inside CS 241, don't worry about that, just use the very first one that it gives back to you","width":387},{"text":"assuming of course that getaddressinfo gives us a success","width":281},{"text":"result code","width":86},{"text":"but if you are writing a more verbose server, you might say i wanna connect to the BBC","width":238},{"text":"and i don't care if you can find a good IP 4 connection or good IP 6 connection i know what i'll just try both","width":613},{"text":"alright so, in fact you get this linkedlist","width":336},{"text":"alright so what have we got inside this addrinfo ","width":168},{"text":"alright we've seen these um, this half up here which is kind of a description of what we want","width":413},{"text":"this is the stuff that we are probably gonna be using in our code later on","width":300},{"text":"and that is this structure here, sockaddr","width":293},{"text":"and also the number of bytes in that address","width":190},{"text":"so you'll be seeing us passing those addresss. so you'll be seeing us passing those two fields","width":191},{"text":"into our connect call and our bind calls in a little bit","width":251},{"text":"ok so watch out for these, so this is the stuff that is setting up for us so we don't need to set up","width":501},{"text":"ok alright so we got our addrinfos","width":286},{"text":"alright so","width":128},{"text":"how many addrinfoes does it return? 0, 1 or more?","width":310},{"text":"i promise you that we'll never return you a negative number","width":297},{"text":"OK um. ","width":152},{"text":"one little thing that you might notice on the code before which is that if getaddressinfo fails","width":680},{"text":"you can't use perror() or structerror","width":342},{"text":"no, it doesn't set error number like that it's got its own error","width":427},{"text":"error code that you could use to return an error","width":371},{"text":"and we'll look that up in a bit","width":95},{"text":"instead i wanna charge through this because I actually want to get to the demo today","width":157},{"text":"the demo is the most fun","width":79},{"text":"but so what is AF_INET6?","width":177},{"text":"what kind of address family is this","width":267},{"text":"it is, yes, IP 6","width":298},{"text":"IP version 6. well we can talk about nodes we can talk about hosts, we can talk about machines","width":374},{"text":"using 128 bits of addressing","width":150},{"text":"in other words our address base is much larger","width":147},{"text":"alright so it's gonna take us a while to exhaust 2^128 possible addresses","width":702},{"text":"so IP version 6 was created because people foresaw the problem that hey we are starting to run out of addresses with IP version 4","width":954},{"text":"so what do you think this might be","width":297},{"text":"I'll give you a clue","width":660},{"text":"there's no place like home","width":113},{"text":"this is how we talk about our localhost ","width":244},{"text":"using IP version 6. so if you want to hack yourself using IP version 6, this is the address you need to connect to","width":527},{"text":"there is actually a shorthand for this where we can collapse the longest ones and zeros","width":371},{"text":"and so there the shortest version of this is just ::1","width":266},{"text":"i'm not gonna talk about all the rules about collapsing IP version 6 addresses","width":356},{"text":"you're welcome to look them up but i guarantee you that they won't be on the exams. the wikipedia references is perfectly good enough","width":385},{"text":"if you ever need to actually need to talk about IP version 6 addresses","width":207},{"text":"but that's the shortest IP address IP v 6 address.","width":431},{"text":"and yes this might be on the exam or this should become acknowledged that hey, this is yourself and this is localhost","width":384}],

  [{"text":"okay so lets see if we can set this up then","width":540},{"text":"I'm going to start writing some code then to make a TCP conneciton","width":319},{"text":"so yes we need to setup one of these int objects","width":242},{"text":"and we'll have a pointer as well to get the result","width":186},{"text":"so what should i set for the family?","width":508},{"text":"well if i want to connect with version 4 I would be connecting with IF_INET6","width":530},{"text":"if i want to do ip version 6 i would put a 6 in here","width":480},{"text":"and what about the socket","width":95},{"text":"Well we want a stream based protocol","width":151},{"text":"in other words TCP","width":104},{"text":"so for our socket type we specify socket stream","width":439},{"text":"if i had left these entries as zero","width":278},{"text":"we're basically saying hey we don't care","width":154},{"text":"and then we get back that linkedlist","width":145},{"text":"what are you connect to the BBC using the UDP","width":169},{"text":"using um datagrams","width":111},{"text":"you could connect using tcp","width":62},{"text":"and these would just be different entries in that linkedlist","width":271},{"text":"and then your code could try them all","width":116},{"text":"hey lets see if we can get a webpage over udp","width":212},{"text":"and the answer is actually quite a few webservers will do that","width":201},{"text":"they'll look at you strangely and go what do you want?","width":153},{"text":"but they will actually say okay I'll give you back some data as a single packet","width":354},{"text":"right so right we're going to fill this in","width":315},{"text":"ok so what do we put in here","width":148},{"text":"our function call of course is get address info","width":375},{"text":"and what do we pass over here","width":83},{"text":"well we need to pass in the hints","width":274},{"text":"and we need to pass in our reult","width":301},{"text":"okay, so lets see if your neighbor can first of all the mistakes i've just deliberately made in that code","width":606},{"text":"and also what are the two missing things that I need to fill in here","width":421},{"text":"what are the first two parameters","width":164},{"text":"so what mistakes did I make and what's missing in that code","width":6645},{"text":"okay right so ","width":178},{"text":"couple a mistakes we made","width":80},{"text":"first of all actually we want the address of our hint struct","width":205},{"text":"so we'll put an ampersand there","width":117},{"text":"and also we want the address of this pointer","width":179},{"text":"it's going to change that pointer for us","width":348},{"text":"ok so what do we pass in here?","width":132},{"text":"well we pass in sometimes it's called the node but you can think of it as just basically the machine we want to connect to","width":368},{"text":"so we could write www.illinois.edu","width":194},{"text":"we could write www.bbc","width":120},{"text":"we could write we could say for example do ::1 if we wanted to connect to ourselves using IP6","width":544},{"text":"we could write 127.0.0.1","width":366},{"text":"if we wanted to connect to ourselves and we were using ip4","width":378},{"text":"for here, i'm going to now specify the port","width":146},{"text":"and you can do this with two ways you can literally just write a string","width":235},{"text":"like 1234","width":383},{"text":"but for well known ports like HTTP, HTTPs you can actually write the protocol name","width":575},{"text":"like HTTPS ","width":451},{"text":"if you happen to know the port number, yeah you could use that","width":416},{"text":"so get address info is surprisingly useful","width":166},{"text":"if you give it a ASCII name it will try to convert that to a port number","width":332},{"text":"for you","width":639},{"text":"so if it returns zero we've succeeded","width":357},{"text":"if it fails now we can actually find out why","width":226},{"text":"and that's where that function comes in ","width":267},{"text":"we could call gai_strerror and pass in that result code","width":725},{"text":"and that would give us back string","width":246},{"text":"okay now I'm not going to expect you to remember that, the string error","width":346},{"text":"but what you might do as a system programmer","width":251},{"text":"with this networking code and in fact any time you want to write good code","width":251},{"text":"is check the manpages","width":93},{"text":"so if we were to go to manpages","width":194},{"text":"is this going to work here we go","width":92},{"text":"alright","width":200},{"text":"we see that um okay i can take the return ","width":298},{"text":"if i now read the description and the return value of this it would tell me that hey this integer can be plugged into this call","width":461},{"text":"to give me a basic message about what went wrong","width":256},{"text":"and let's have a quick look down here to see the kind of things that can go wrong","width":338},{"text":"we have a bad family bad flags","width":253},{"text":"no data no name","width":136},{"text":"this call can fail in all sorts of ways","width":186},{"text":"we might fail at turning a name like bbc.com into an ip address","width":599},{"text":"okay but lets say it worked","width":214},{"text":"what do we do next","width":102},{"text":"well the first thing we might do is okay let's make a new socket","width":318},{"text":"now you seen in some of my earlier examples that i've made the socket at the very beginning of the code","width":243},{"text":"and i hardcoded in exactly what family and type of socket type I wanted","width":559},{"text":"but you could also just use the return values","width":256}],
  // Part 2
  [{"text":"there we go","width":86},{"text":"we've also go the information we need inside here to actually create the socket","width":256},{"text":"so if you expect you'll get address info to return maybe an IP6 ","width":382},{"text":"maybe multiple kinds of different sockets","width":157},{"text":"then you'd be pulling that information out of that linkedlist each time","width":277},{"text":"so we've called socket and then we would try","width":441},{"text":"to connect to that remote host","width":275},{"text":"and let's say we've successfully got a connection","width":176},{"text":"hey great we're now talking to that machine","width":243},{"text":"right so this connect call is heavy it's big it's slow ","width":310},{"text":"it actually goes out there and connects","width":149},{"text":"it doesn't just like \"oh, connect please\" it's \"no make contact\"","width":238},{"text":"send some packets to and from that machine","width":267},{"text":"so connect might take a second or more to complete","width":212},{"text":"might take a minute","width":131},{"text":"if you're remote server you're trying to connect to is a long way away","width":303},{"text":"so this is potentially very very slow","width":213},{"text":"how quickly you can talk to the remote machine","width":364},{"text":"if you're trying to talk to yourself that should be pretty fast","width":323},{"text":"so you could talk to yourself very quickly and discover if you can connect to a particular port","width":491},{"text":"there's one thing we didn't talk about yet","width":177},{"text":"and that is ","width":288},{"text":"this magic call called bind","width":299},{"text":"so usually we don't like to be bound up","width":340},{"text":"but today we're going to be calling bind on our socket","width":250},{"text":"we're going to take our socket and we're going to bind it to a particular local port","width":494},{"text":"we're gonna say \"hey! use this local port\"","width":258},{"text":"now most of the time when you want to connect to a remote server","width":124},{"text":"you don't care where your packets leave from","width":170},{"text":"you don't care which port is used locally","width":213},{"text":"just let the operating system let the kernel choose the outgoing port","width":368},{"text":"but when we want to make a server typically we do care","width":150},{"text":"if I'm going to make a webserver I want it to be on port 80","width":457},{"text":"so we can use bind if we want to set the ","width":561},{"text":"local port","width":507},{"text":"you could also use it if you've got say two network cards","width":200},{"text":"and you want to specifically use a particular network card","width":592},{"text":"but it controls the local side of the connection","width":1433},{"text":"","width":2},{"text":"which is exactly what we're going to need when we make a server","width":649},{"text":"","width":1},{"text":"so if i tried to connect to your cellphone right now on a particular port","width":545},{"text":"i'd probably discover that it's not listening on that particular port that I was connect to","width":247},{"text":"connect would return back and say haha I'm sorry I've failed","width":215},{"text":"I've managed to send a packet and it said nothing ","width":193},{"text":"i didn't get anything back","width":91},{"text":"for your cellphone","width":54},{"text":"so connect fails","width":178},{"text":"what we ought to do in the server is the opposite","width":305},{"text":"we want to sit here and wait for people to come to us","width":275},{"text":"wait for packets to come to us","width":107},{"text":"wait for packets to come to our port","width":158},{"text":"what we want then is a passive connection","width":207},{"text":"not something that goes out and tries to connect","width":140},{"text":"but just sits there and says huh no let us the packets come to us","width":349},{"text":"we can do this","width":119},{"text":"and it's very very easy","width":272},{"text":"alright so a passive socket level one understanding is just hey it waits for connections to connect to it","width":623},{"text":"it's sitting on the key side of the particular port saying okay I'm on port 80 send your packets to me I'm ready","width":413},{"text":"and when they do I'm going to do something special","width":151},{"text":"right so what's a passive socket ","width":121},{"text":"first of all it's a socket that is listening ","width":254},{"text":"it's also known sometimes as a server socket","width":414},{"text":"because we use it for serving we just it for waiting for connections","width":358},{"text":"so it's passive in the sense that it's waiting for connections","width":705},{"text":"and it has a cute little trick","width":610},{"text":"","width":1},{"text":"lets say I'm the client, you're the server","width":182},{"text":"can you catch?","width":252},{"text":"let's say you're the server","width":78},{"text":"right there you go","width":307},{"text":"that ladies and gentlemen is a dropped packet","width":338},{"text":"alright here","width":237},{"text":"that server wasn't listening","width":588},{"text":"okay fantastic right","width":130},{"text":"so I've sent my-k-I've just connected to the server","width":339},{"text":"on the passive socket","width":63},{"text":"now here's what the passive socket does","width":197},{"text":"when it returns the connection, when it does the handshake back to me","width":446},{"text":"thank you","width":167},{"text":"it sends an additional piece of information which is","width":183},{"text":"don't talk to me, don't talk to that port anymore","width":199},{"text":"I've got a new port set up just there","width":321},{"text":"that is the special connection that is just between you and me","width":417},{"text":"so we'll see that in a moment on the C side as well ","width":127},{"text":"we'll see that on the seaside, I like that","width":110},{"text":"so we'll see that in terms an additional file descriptor","width":263},{"text":"that's part of that handshaking","width":139},{"text":"once we make the connection on the server side,","width":124},{"text":"no no we have a completely different port just for that one connection","width":347},{"text":"why do we do that?","width":60},{"text":"well guess what we're making a server","width":135},{"text":"we're trying to take over the world or whatever","width":120},{"text":"and other people might be connecting to port 80","width":210},{"text":"as soon as they do that they're going to be talking to you again","width":195},{"text":"so in order to keep all these connections separated","width":227},{"text":"we push them onto different ports","width":284},{"text":"alright so the time you actually spend talking to this particular port is minimal","width":330},{"text":"okay so why do we create one","width":181},{"text":"so we can have a server","width":529},{"text":"I want to make a server","width":231},{"text":"right so how do i do all this","width":199},{"text":"have I put this in yet no","width":86},{"text":"so here's what we should do ","width":136},{"text":"in our hints struct","width":389},{"text":"we're going to specify one more thing","width":209},{"text":"let's go back to here","width":62},{"text":"something we haven't used yet is this flags","width":808},{"text":"and there's a flag to say","width":181},{"text":"hey make a passive socket for me please","width":517},{"text":"trying to think if it's yeah must be uppercase right","width":646},{"text":"so before making your get address info call, just say oh, by the way, I would like a passive socket","width":576},{"text":"by the way i would like a passive socket","width":256}],

mean you didn't set all of the parameters in a field?","width":509},{"text":"don't worry, I'll make your code work today","width":311},{"text":"but, if we don't set all the fields inside a struct, then who's to know what the values are of the ones that we didn't set","width":443},{"text":"now maybe you made it in global memory","width":314},{"text":"and you know that there's going to be zero but if we didn't","width":223},{"text":"if we just made it on the stack","width":128},{"text":"then who knows what those global fields are going to be","width":301},{"text":"and we're just giving them to the operating system","width":133},{"text":"so who knows how getaddressinfo is going to interpret those unset fields","width":433},{"text":"so I'm talking about these in terms of setting up network code but this is actually a common common gotcha with C","width":353},{"text":"is you hey I've got a struct, I'll set a few things and I forget to set the other fields","width":435},{"text":"so right how can I fix that? well I showed you before","width":178},{"text":"one way is to call memset","width":101},{"text":"okay so how about we do this? memset on the hints","width":877},{"text":"sizeof(hints)","width":288},{"text":"zero","width":159},{"text":"and I can relax that I've now got job security","width":307},{"text":"my code will work!","width":535},{"text":"haha april fools","width":697},{"text":"so what have I just done?","width":128},{"text":"I've just managed to set zero number of bytes","width":216},{"text":"to a small integer value","width":164},{"text":"in other words the memset call I just made had no effect whatsoever","width":385},{"text":"because I accidentally swapped these two values around","width":586},{"text":"I suggest that you ideally just don't make this mistake","width":685},{"text":"or don't make this mistake in production code","width":305},{"text":"because the worst thing about it is that you probably won't realize it, you probably won't notice it right?","width":273},{"text":"the memory half the time is zero","width":140},{"text":"and it's only when say you are reusing old stack memory that you might not get nonzero values","width":371},{"text":"so watch out, watch out anytime you work directly with memory","width":235},{"text":"that's the most likely time that you'll get some very subtle bugs","width":484},{"text":"right so we've got our thing set up","width":158},{"text":"getaddressinfo is returning zero, it's working, right so...","width":394},{"text":"here's what we can do now","width":190},{"text":"remember how I said...","width":228},{"text":"in a client we make a socket and then we call connect","width":337},{"text":"and we connect to a remote end","width":109},{"text":"in a server, we go socket and bind","width":600},{"text":"we're not trying to connect to a remote end at all","width":260},{"text":"we're just saying ha I just want to set up a local socket here","width":189},{"text":"that doesn't connect to anything, it's just going to sit there and listen","width":200},{"text":"and all the parameters that we pass to connect to the same ones as bind","width":263},{"text":"so we're going to be passing in...","width":250},{"text":"these two again, this address and that length of that struct","width":215},{"text":"we'll see the real code in a moment","width":94},{"text":"but basically we've swapped our connect for a bind","width":195},{"text":"because we want to talk about not a remote endpoint but a local endpoint","width":342},{"text":"right... so at this point we'll just take a little bit of a break to","width":702},{"text":"mention these guys","width":285},{"text":"and also to kind of show you what the code might look like if you didn't have getaddressinfo","width":939},{"text":"so when setting up a socket","width":386},{"text":"one of the things we want to talk about then is the port address and the IP address","width":549},{"text":"and you'll notice if you do a lot of google searching on code, you'll quickly come across these functions here","width":330},{"text":"this htonl and htons","width":499},{"text":"here's what they do, they swap bytes around","width":354},{"text":"sometimes","width":140},{"text":"they swap bytes if you run this on an x86 intel machine","width":493},{"text":"why?","width":141},{"text":"why do you think we might want to swap the ordering of bytes?","width":716},{"text":"security?","width":276},{"text":"good idea but not the answer I was looking for","width":210},{"text":"endianness yes!","width":208},{"text":"so endianness why do we care about endianness well the point is we're sending information over the wire right?","width":443},{"text":"we're sending stuff out to the network, we don't want it to depend on the order with which we represent integers","width":415},{"text":"so if we're talking about a particular port number","width":151},{"text":"that's sixteen bits","width":104},{"text":"we better agree when we send the packet out on the network as to whether we want to put the low byte first or the upper byte first","width":594},{"text":"so network order is big endian","width":321},{"text":"and that should be independent of our machine","width":150},{"text":"so if the kernel says by the way, this remote host is connected to you on this particular port","width":405},{"text":"or here's this ip addresses","width":209},{"text":"we better be careful, these integers may not actually be the integers that we normally understand","width":373},{"text":"we may actually have to deliberately read that value with the bytes swapped","width":538},{"text":"so that's where these functions come in","width":124},{"text":"if you happen to compiling this code on a little endian machine","width":291},{"text":"big endian machine, they don't do anything, they are a no op they don't need to swap any bytes","width":291},{"text":"if you call them on an intel machine however, they give you the result with the bytes correctly swapped from big endian order to little endian order","width":576}],

short","width":195},{"text":"[silence]","width":1129},{"text":"so here's an example","width":179},{"text":"where we want to specify the port","width":211},{"text":"as port 1100","width":182},{"text":"notice how I chose a port greater than 1024 ","width":189},{"text":"and I want to set it directly into this structure here","width":291},{"text":"socket

going to be passed directly into the network card we're going to assemble the packet and that packet will have these bytes in now the correct order to say okay [something] on this particular port","width":1085},{"text":"you can use these inside your own code","width":205},{"text":"let's say you wanted to have a high performance server","width":236},{"text":"and you're not going to send ascii information, you actually want to send binary information","width":236},{"text":"and you want to send say the position of your players to all of the other, you want to cast it out to all of the order players on your game server","width":768},{"text":"you would have to decide on your protocol to say am I going to send this out in little endian or big endian format","width":312},{"text":"and you could use these kinds of calls to make sure that it doesn't matter whether your C code is compiling on an ARM platform an Intel platform","width":591},{"text":"that we always on the network are sending bytes out in the same order","width":368},{"text":"same endianness ","width":154},{"text":"alright so that's just a little aside, you'll see these codes and now you know what they do","width":250},{"text":"and here's the other one where you use it for a long so you can use it for 32 bits","width":434},{"text":"right so okay right","width":291},{"text":"so it's quite often said that setting up a server takes four cores","width":285},{"text":"we better say what they are","width":233},{"text":"and it's a common exam question or interview question to say what's the order of these?","width":306},{"text":"and what does each one do?","width":162},{"text":"right so the first one is easy, hey we need a socket","width":181},{"text":"you're not going to get very far without a socket","width":112},{"text":"we need a way to configure our network","width":339},{"text":"and a socket gives us back a file descriptor that we can then start to use","width":248},{"text":"once we've got that file descriptor","width":289},{"text":"we want to bind it to a local port","width":921},{"text":"let's bind it so we are now going to be on a particular local part and we set it up, we pass it","width":627},{"text":"now actually we're ready to go","width":145},{"text":"here's the nice thing that we can do with server sockets","width":269},{"text":"we can ask the kernel to do that little handoff trick and to start queuing up any connections","width":364},{"text":"so now we can start listening","width":213},{"text":"at that moment...","width":204},{"text":"we're live!","width":71},{"text":"our kernel is starting to actually accept connections for us","width":266},{"text":"and we'll generate a small queue of incoming connections that we can now start to process","width":375},{"text":"so with listen, we actually specify the queue size","width":660},{"text":"so as part of that little handoff process when we say oh actually go and reconnect to me next time on this other port number","width":396},{"text":"now the kernel has taken that and said okay by the way expect connections on this other port number, so internally its got a little queue","width":516},{"text":"when we want it from our user's side, we call...","width":339},{"text":"yes I'm prepared to accept this reverse call","width":520},{"text":"accept!","width":411},{"text":"so on the server side, when you call accept, you get...","width":407},{"text":"a new file descriptor","width":268},{"text":"okay so here's a big gotcha","width":156},{"text":"is that you've now actually got two file descriptors to play with","width":222},{"text":"if you want to be talking to your clients that are connecting","width":226},{"text":"this is one","width":202},{"text":"you get a new file descriptor each time accept returns","width":397},{"text":"also, this blocks","width":634},{"text":"until we have a client","width":243},{"text":"if your code is a bit slow in calling accept","width":185},{"text":"don't panic, that's why we called listen","width":148},{"text":"listen says look uhh my user code may not be able to call it except immediately so have a little backlog of connections that the kernel will maintain","width":720},{"text":"and hopefully I'll be able to call accept in the future","width":169},{"text":"so its very simple code, very simple server","width":306},{"text":"we can just call accept once, and that's it and that's what we'll do in a demo in a moment","width":231},{"text":"later can call accept in the loop to process one client at a time","width":399},{"text":"probably not going to be the best webserver in the world","width":222},{"text":"but hey it works and we can run that on some tiny embedded hardware","width":331},{"text":"later we might do things like hey let's for every accept call start a new thread","width":405},{"text":"and then everybody can talk to my server in parallel","width":387},{"text":"well that works until a thousand people try to connect and then you have a thousand threads that start on a machine with 8 CPUs that's probably going to work out so great","width":710},{"text":"so then we need to start figuring out even better ways to have a high performance server","width":368},{"text":"but anyways that's our four calls, socket, bind, listen and accept","width":240},{"text":"alright let's see this in action","width":300},{"text":"ooh look code!","width":192}],
  // Part 5
  [{"text":"Here we go! I'm going just hard code my, my constants. Like I said, we could have got this back from the address info.","width":764},{"text":"Today, I want to play with IP4, I want a TTP connection. There's my flags, those other flags you can set them here by bit-wise or-ing them.","width":591},{"text":"But we want a uh... a server, or passive connection. Yes, I remembered to set all my other unused fields to zero.","width":935},{"text":"Right. Yes, I'm going to call getaddrinfo. Check the result code; if it fails, I'll turn that into a useful error message.","width":610},{"text":"It's really really useful if your code doesn't work to actually check error messages by the way.","width":446},{"text":"Okay, so. We got a socket call, we got a bind let's connect to a local port.","width":460},{"text":"And look at this! I'm using the stuff I got from my getaddrinfo. I'm passing in that point of that struct and the size of that struct.","width":697},{"text":"okay, that's my set up: socket bind.","width":191},{"text":"Now, we start to say, \"Ooh!\" Um, please start listening and have a little backlog of ten connections.","width":583},{"text":"Okay. So, just for fun, I want to show you that I can say, \"I'm just doing a particular port. If I reach into one of these low-level C structures, I better remember to reverse the right order to turn it into from network to host (ntohs) and use the result of that call.","width":1955},{"text":"And now we're going to have our little server.","width":362},{"text":"This server code didn't actually send anything back to the client. It just listens to hear what the client has got to say.","width":438},{"text":"How do we do that? We call accept. Later on if we wanted to have to fill in the structure, like where the client was connecting from. We wanted their own IP address we can fill out these structures here.","width":923},{"text":"And remember how I said accept returns a new client? Here it is! Here is a new file descriptor (fd), and I'm going to use that on my read call and then turn it into a C string and print out what they said. Okay","width":1098},{"text":"So, let's uh, let's run this.","width":812},{"text":"Hmm. *bzzzzzzzzzzzz* Okie dokie, alright, so there's no error checking in this last part, um, alright.","width":515},{"text":"So I can... clear this right gcc ./server1 (./server1.c). Okay! Alright","width":1337},{"text":"Oh, look at that! That's my OSX is saying do you want to accept it?","width":329},{"text":"Wait! And it chose file descriptor 3, is this your port 1234? Shall we connect to it?","width":616},{"text":"Okay, alright. So, let's do this um, now I could write some C code, but instead I want to show you a pretty useful tool. It's called netcat.","width":1021},{"text":"Here is netcat. Blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah. Look it's like cat, except you can connect to an arbitrary machine, using an arbitrary protocol.","width":891},{"text":"And anything we sent this, it will use standard in and standard out.","width":546},{"text":"So today, I want to connect to 127.0.0.1, my local host, and I want to connect to port 1234.","width":1168},{"text":"So our code is working! The accept call has returned. ","width":192},{"text":"And it has given back our new file descriptor. Right, should we send something to it! Yes, okay here we go. HELLO GET / HTTP/1928349q87eyfaiu7tbeiqvwfa SAfuigae","width":831},{"text":"And here we go. So, it got that from the socket and printed that and stopped.","width":597},{"text":"This is the most useless web server in the world because it accepts one request then quits.","width":539},{"text":"Very easy to make a denial of service (DOS) on this particular web server. So what we'll do is make it so it cannot accept multiple clients. We're not going to do any threading code in this (we could though!). Right as soon as accept returns, why don't we make a new thread and pass it on.","width":992},{"text":"Instead, we'll just put this little part inside a loop. Alright so a while there.","width":913},{"text":"Okay, so we put this accept call inside a loop","width":1773},{"text":"Make another connection, and so on and so on. So we got the basics now of a little web server. What we have to do now is figure out how we are going to pause this. what do we want to do with this information, and what do we want to send back to the client?","width":1271},{"text":"Alright, so in fact what we've made is something a bit like a honey pot. For example, here's why it's called a honey pot.Take a jar of honey, open it, and see what insects are there after a minute or an hour. We can do this with our server. We can get it to simply listen on a particular port and see who connects and say capture the IP address. Or we can pretend to masquarade to build a real machine. Oh look! people are trying to log into this let's see what kind of pass","width":2502},{"text":"let's see what password they typed in.","width":223},{"text":"We can see what kind of attacks they do to our machines.","width":283},{"text":"So, on many modern networks now we have these machines which appear to be real machines, but which are infact are simple honey pots.","width":556},{"text":"This is the simplest kind, right? Where we can simply log the connection attempts, who they're from, and what information is sent to us.","width":704}],
  // Part 6
  [{"text":"Alright, another thing we're going to finish today is epoll.","width":558},{"text":"So I suggest for a simple server, hey, just uh, just little while loop.","width":296},{"text":"The next simple server is: hey make a thread so at least we can do this with uh multiple threads so that I can be servicing two clients at the same time.threads so","width":751},{"text":"Well, these kinds of ideas work until now you have hundreds or thousands of clients connected to it at the same time.","width":513},{"text":"And um, a bit of history is that we used to have a core called \"select\" you'll find in everywhere (works in a mac), but these days, epoll is a common solution to a hyperbolic server; in fact, you'll get to play with that this section.","width":1153},{"text":"And what epoll will ask you to do is with sockets or pipes, and you'll get to play with pipes.","width":455},{"text":"You can say, \"Actually, there's a whole load of file descriptors that I'm interested in.\"","width":338},{"text":"And so, the basic outline of epoll is: you make, we make a set you'll create, and then, using a control function we add a whole load of file descriptors, a whole load of file descriptors.","width":1541},{"text":"You say you'd want to read or write to these. What's your intent?","width":836},{"text":"And then you can wait--wait for an event.","width":477},{"text":"That's the basic idea.","width":126},{"text":"So actually now, I can have a single thread waiting on a thousand clients.","width":375},{"text":"If my clients don't talk to me very much, when one of them does, I can immediately find out which one.","width":500},{"text":"...because epoll call will tell me, \"Hey! By the way, now you have to talk to this particular file descriptor, now you need to be talking to this particular file descriptor.\"","width":502},{"text":"The old way of using select: will select allow me to go to sleep once something is happening; but once select returns, I'd have to kind of go through every single file descriptor. I'd have to do a linear search to find out which file descriptor was the one that I need to process.","width":1348},{"text":"So, that would be in session this week with epoll, and the other section thing we hope to do with sections tomorrow is to connect some class 7 code on the tablets as well.","width":877},{"text":"With that, have a wonderful week! Good luck with the MPs! I'll see you on Friday <3","width":384}],

any quick questions?","width":251.18181824684143},{"text":"okay right let's jump into some other kind of little bits of know how then","width":488.18181824684143},{"text":"so we've been making servers that listen on a particular port","width":299.18181824684143},{"text":"if you're just doing development, you may not care which port your server listens on","width":544.1818182468414},{"text":"you'll just say hey give me any port that's currently unused","width":233.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we can do this","width":103.18181824684143},{"text":"first of all when you call getaddressinfo if we're setting up a server, obviously we want to talk about localhost, that's NULL","width":365.18181824684143},{"text":"and just say I want port zero which is another way to say hey I'll be happy with any port","width":393.18181824684143},{"text":"well now we've got a problem though, we need to find out which port number we're actually listening on","width":482.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we do this, there's something called getsockname","width":372.18181824684143},{"text":"sock of course stands for socket","width":154.18181824684143},{"text":"as opposed to things you wear on your feat","width":318.18181824684143},{"text":"this code kind of looks a little bit like the code you might have been writing before getaddressinfo existed","width":414.18181824684143},{"text":"we have these different structs for example...","width":253.18181824684143},{"text":"there's this sockaddr in which you can think of as a version or as a subclass of this other struct","width":846.1818182468414},{"text":"but because C doesn't support [something] we can't say hey this extends this other struct","width":510.18181824684143},{"text":"we have to forcibly typecast it","width":234.18181824684143},{"text":"and so there's all sorts of interesting gotchas, any days that you forcibly type stuff you might forget for example to put in the ampersand here","width":531.1818182468414},{"text":"so there's all sorts of gotchas","width":302.18181824684143},{"text":"I'm not going to ask this on an exam, I'm just pointing out, if you want to develop code that listens on any port, this is the way to do it","width":590.1818182468414},{"text":"you call getsockname on your socket","width":253.18181824684143},{"text":"and now we from that struct we can figure out which port","width":325.18181824684143},{"text":"there's just one little gotcha here","width":157.18181824684143},{"text":"if we try to use this value directly.. hahaha","width":255.18181824684143},{"text":"oooooooh we're going to be in a world of pain","width":268.18181824684143},{"text":"why?","width":205.18181824684143}],

structures to do with hey the bytes that we're trying to send to the network card","width":468.18181824684143},{"text":"the port number that is represented inside this struct is not really an integer like we like to think of it like an integer that's on our CPU","width":675.1818182468414},{"text":"so if we actually want the value of this entry, we've got to convert it","width":384.18181824684143},{"text":"so don't forget to call...","width":321.18181824684143},{"text":"network to host short ntohs","width":360.18181824684143},{"text":"and that will give us back an integer value that is actually the integer of the port","width":395.18181824684143},{"text":"so next time you hate your lab partner, just walk over and delete that code and watch them try to connect to the wrong port for the rest of the discussion section","width":650.1818182468414},{"text":"right so that's a little gotcha there, no one will tell you that you've forgotten to convert your integer to the right value","width":354.18181824684143},{"text":"other than the fact that you'll be trying to connect to the incorrect port","width":320.18181824684143},{"text":"the other thing you might want to do is find out who is connecting to your server","width":225.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we can do that, remember this accept call, the thing that blocks waiting for a client to connect","width":493.18181824684143},{"text":"remember how it gives us back a new file descriptor?","width":281.18181824684143},{"text":"well we can now pass in a pointer to a

information about the remote client","width":541.1818182468414},{"text":"it won't tell you their login name but we can find out things like their IP address","width":324.18181824684143},{"text":"and their port number","width":77.18181824684143},{"text":"so for example, if you didn't like the remote client, why don't you send a thousand packets back to them and try and shut down their machine and send them a denial of service","width":525.1818182468414},{"text":"no don't do that for real unless you happen to be the US government","width":325.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so we've got that information and we now want to print something out","width":284.18181824684143},{"text":"here's how we can do it","width":87.18181824684143},{"text":"you can say okay turn this number to an ASCII value","width":364.18181824684143},{"text":"and that will turn it into an IP4 address like 127.0.0.1 we can see that","width":463.18181824684143},{"text":"and also with the port number, oh look here we go again, don't forget to convert that struct entry into a real number","width":478.18181824684143},{"text":"and then we'll print it out","width":74.18181824684143},{"text":"okay so let's see that as a demo","width":461.18181824684143},{"text":"okie dokie","width":166.18181824684143},{"text":"so I'll go to server2 let's see if this works okay right","width":683.1818182468414},{"text":"right so I've got my code now, it just picks an arbitrary port number that is available","width":530.1818182468414},{"text":"and let me try connecting to that","width":266.18181824684143},{"text":"well actually why don't you see if you can connect to that","width":177.18181824684143},{"text":"if anyone's got their laptop open you can telnet to 172.17.248.187","width":478.18181824684143},{"text":"and see if someone connects to that port number","width":473.18181824684143},{"text":"okay fantastic right","width":215.18181824684143},{"text":"and I got your address so now I can telnet back to you for

this is a problem of just how efficient can we be?","width":428.18181824684143},{"text":"can we use our CPU resources and other system resources to get as much work done as possible?","width":700.1818182468414},{"text":"well it turns out of course that earliest deadline first isn't actually the most efficient algorithm","width":374.18181824684143},{"text":"because we might spend a lot of time flipping from one piece of work to another piece of work","width":390.18181824684143},{"text":"and so we actually have addition latency involved with these context switches","width":493.18181824684143},{"text":"and with scheduling all of this work","width":183.18181824684143},{"text":"so for example, if you find yourself constantly updating your calendar to say oh I'm going to do this work here and this work here","width":337.18181824684143},{"text":"you've chosen an inefficient scheduling algorithm","width":287.18181824684143}],

where is UDP actually used?","width":406},{"text":"You will see UDP packets for DNS","width":336},{"text":"domain name service","width":120},{"text":"So when you type in something like HEY","width":141},{"text":"I want to go to the host which say its bbc.com","width":305},{"text":"Somebody somewhere needs to know how to translate this address to an IPv4 or IPv6

kind of turned this into a stream","width":133},{"text":"But packets might get lost","width":64},{"text":"It might get duplicated","width":171},{"text":"So our trick is to keep track of the total number of bytes that we've successively sent in each direction","width":538},{"text":"So we'll mark each packet with where we are in the stream","width":399},{"text":"So we have a sequence number","width":85},{"text":"It represents the actual number of bytes that have been transferred in this direction so far","width":359},{"text":"So this means if we lose some packets","width":159},{"text":"The other end can say","width":144},{"text":"HEY","width":28},{"text":"I lost you.

why I think its really cool","width":151},{"text":"wouldn't it be nice if you could go back to a lecture and say","width":188},{"text":"uh yeah uhh what was he saying when he talked about this term or that term","width":356},{"text":"which lecture was it in when","width":124},{"text":"the instructor or lecturer mentioned x y z","width":199},{"text":"so thats the idea is so can we transcribe lectures","width":246},{"text":"recorded lectures","width":75},{"text":"and then make subtitles?","width":199},{"text":"for people with strong english accents like myself?","width":137},{"text":"and for searching as well","width":178},{"text":"so for example","width":84},{"text":"remember those 241 videos that I made for the beginning of the course?","width":399},{"text":"supposed you wanted to find all the lectures where I mentioned printf()","width":249},{"text":"so we can kind of google search it and in real time find it","width":207},{"text":"oh yeah thats the one I wanted","width":165},{"text":"and you click on this and ","width":301},{"text":"my machine seems to be a bit slow today","width":107},{"text":"probably because its friday","width":213},{"text":"and off it goes and uh we can review the concepts","width":197},{"text":"so we've done that now for those mini videos","width":317},{"text":"and now I want to do that for 241 content","width":301},{"text":"and then we're going to take over the world","width":141},{"text":"the plan is to make it successful in this course and then say to the college why don't we do this for other courses as well inside the collge","width":445},{"text":"I'm already trying to make ways to prepare the lectures to say hey you know your course is recorded","width":381},{"text":"hey you could do so much more.","width":104},{"text":"lets make it successful inside 241 first","width":186},{"text":"so heres the plan","width":23},{"text":"we take a one hour video and we divide it into chunks","width":202},{"text":"short say 7 minute chunks","width":108},{"text":"and then you just take a short amount of time to type it in","width":256},{"text":"there is a second pass where you take those phrases someone else has done and you make sure they're lined up to the right part of the video","width":447},{"text":"its very easy work and we think it might might actually improve your grade","width":208},{"text":"because you're spending time on tasks because you're actually reviewing the content","width":281},{"text":"so thats the idea","width":111},{"text":"thats the promise","width":55},{"text":"lets see if it happens","width":64},{"text":"so please consider signing up and to help uh feel good about doing this","width":438},{"text":"um","width":14},{"text":"myself and another professor from Beckman","width":255},{"text":"we're going to throw in 50 dollars of our own cash each

time","width":283},{"text":"okay so thats class transcribe","width":176},{"text":"lets make this big lets make it big enough that we can crowdsource this","width":233},{"text":"and make it so that it actually even works for other universities as well","width":304},{"text":"okay right so back to today's content","width":210},{"text":"oops I had an overhead","width":401},{"text":"right

  [{"text":"So how can we find that the inode if you're the command line, you could just uh","width":586},{"text":"pass in uh on the side, ls","width":215},{"text":"or from code

variations","width":224},{"text":"one is you supply a path, ","width":267},{"text":"so for example, I could say ","width":192},{"text":"stat","width":147},{"text":"on my file demo.c","width":265},{"text":"and pass in a pointer to","width":258},{"text":"my struct","width":301},{"text":"another is I pass in a file descriptor","width":710},{"text":"Now if you're going to start reading things from uh","width":246},{"text":"the buffer that's set","width":260},{"text":"make sure that you check the return value right? so you want to check the uh","width":466},{"text":"the result is 0","width":191},{"text":"otherwise its succesful","width":143},{"text":"if it's non-zero then that's ","width":174},{"text":"that uh C structure uh was never touched","width":248},{"text":"and you'll just read garbage or old values","width":270},{"text":"so it's a common programming gotcha. just assume that stat just worked ","width":213},{"text":"and then try to pull out um","width":190},{"text":"uh values and information from that stat","width":211},{"text":"where its in fact, stat says huh I don't know file or you don't have permission for that file","width":295},{"text":"or hey, it's nice day outside I don't I'll bother to do any work today","width":243},{"text":"Um that's not actually a posix error","width":160},{"text":"The uh","width":172},{"text":"Right so so check the return value of stat","width":487},{"text":"Now I mentioned before you can do fdopen","width":414},{"text":"and uh fdopen allows you to go from a file descriptor at the posix level up to uh","width":378},{"text":"uh a C file pointer complete with buffering and using printf and all that good stuff","width":391},{"text":"You can actually go the other way","width":127},{"text":"There's uh","width":114},{"text":"function called fileno which allows you to extract","width":256},{"text":"theeee","width":124},{"text":"file descriptor","width":112},{"text":"out of C as well","width":344},{"text":"Right so we can fill this in","width":82},{"text":"And there's one other call call here","width":233},{"text":"lstat","width":452},{"text":"So there's one thing we haven't talked about yet","width":173},{"text":"which is","width":225},{"text":"symbolic links","width":173},{"text":"we're gonna play with these in bit. we're just gonna mentioned them today","width":179},{"text":"was gonna say okay this exists","width":140},{"text":"and as a symbolic link","width":106},{"text":"is a file that pretends it doesn't exist","width":243},{"text":"instead it says HAH I don't exist, what you're actually looking for is","width":283},{"text":"over here somewhere and it gives you a redirection","width":270},{"text":"so just like you might move house and could set up your mail forwarding","width":291},{"text":"that's what a symbolic link can do","width":143},{"text":"so, uh you can say, Oh actually the contents that you really want uh","width":296},{"text":"read or write are not  here, they're stored in some other directory","width":333},{"text":"if you want to be evil","width":116},{"text":"you could set the symbolic link to point to another symbolic link which  can point back to the first symbolic link","width":318},{"text":"Muahahhahaah","width":81},{"text":"at which point your machine catches fire","width":303},{"text":"No you won't have been the first person to think of this","width":164},{"text":"and your program wont have been the first program to do this","width":159},{"text":"so instead","width":125},{"text":"the operating says ","width":100},{"text":"hold on a moment, I've been following these these symbolic links too many times","width":232},{"text":"i'm gonna quit trying to follow them and will give up after a preset number of times","width":393},{"text":"But anyway, uh the lstat exists if you actually want information about the symbolic link","width":386},{"text":"itself, rather than trying to follow it","width":1159},{"text":"If you call lstat on a regular file that's fine","width":206},{"text":"it'll just be the just be that equilvalent of calling um stat","width":282},{"text":"so lstat is useful if you are really interested in the symbolic link itself","width":319},{"text":"like who created the symbolic linke, who do I need to blame for this mess right?","width":228},{"text":"or when was it created?","width":213},{"text":"That's pretty unusual, most of the time we actually want to follow those links right?","width":216},{"text":"what most of the time we we just want to imagine that uh","width":231},{"text":"these aliases are automatic","width":552},{"text":"Right any questions so far?","width":174},{"text":"Okay so let's get a have a share of a look to see all the stuff we can kinda discover about the file","width":545},{"text":"First files themselves lives on a device","width":214},{"text":"yeah we know they have an id number","width":192},{"text":"and they have this ","width":152},{"text":"security access as simple protection","width":162},{"text":"where we can talk about who can do what","width":259},{"text":"so we're going to see more of this in the moment","width":158},{"text":"but this is the idea about who can read it, who can write it, and who can execute it","width":447},{"text":"they also have an owner","width":127},{"text":"and","width":122},{"text":"this we've got a user and a group","width":204},{"text":"I'm not gonna talk about groups","width":125},{"text":"much in CS241, just know that they exist","width":190},{"text":"Um if you get into linux administration, maybe it's it's useful if you have a lot of","width":352},{"text":"kind of team members working inside the same directory um","width":184},{"text":"but we're not going to play with them let's just let's just uh umm","width":191},{"text":"restrain our attention to users today","width":275},{"text":"okay","width":279},{"text":"And then the um","width":159},{"text":"total number of ","width":158},{"text":"locks, in actually uh","width":216},{"text":"these happen to be in in multiples of 512 just for historical reasons","width":290},{"text":"uhh and so that tells us, for example, whether the uh the 8th","width":321},{"text":"direct block entry is valid or not, or we

be combined","width":122},{"text":"each individual chunk was sorted using queuesort","width":267},{"text":"and we had say eight threads available to start doing all this merging","width":552},{"text":"now the naive TAs solution was actually not that hard to beat","width":421},{"text":"here's all it did","width":206},{"text":"it simply copied all of these into a large array","width":268},{"text":"and we made a fair guess about how big a size it should be","width":285},{"text":"but we did use realloc just in case the data was going to be larger than expected","width":389},{"text":"but we didn't start off with something small like hey 16 or 32","width":234},{"text":"we gave it a big number because if realloc does need to realloc for space","width":393},{"text":"then it used to call malloc, it needs to then do a memcpy to move all of that data","width":323},{"text":"and talking to memory is slow so we made a good guesstimate about how big a buffer we would need","width":493},{"text":"it simply waited until we got all the pieces","width":319},{"text":"and then it used the part one code","width":391},{"text":"and then it printed out the whole result","width":555},{"text":"right how can we do better?","width":376},{"text":"in this regrade of this we're actually going to put in a small delay between each one to assure that there's actually some significant computational time to work on these items","width":773},{"text":"so some things that we can do which are better, obviously we've got 8 threads we could get started sorting this data before we see the very last piece of data","width":635},{"text":"the other thing we can do is at the very end","width":265},{"text":"we could actually start printing the results","width":254},{"text":"before we finished the final merge","width":289},{"text":"so in the very final merge, as we're pulling these two yellow pieces together","width":342},{"text":"if I got to here, I don't even need to write this data back I could be printing it out to a file","width":605},{"text":"as I merge these results together, so there's actually two optimization ideas","width":384},{"text":"right so what's the simplest way of doing some of these early merges","width":296},{"text":"well one is to say hey doing this stuff thinking about all these different levels is really really complicated","width":398},{"text":"for my tired brain","width":176},{"text":"and so get something simple working, here's a really simple idea","width":312},{"text":"is look at these in pairs","width":167},{"text":"look a lot of merging actually just takes down here at the smallest level","width":333},{"text":"so we could get some speed up","width":172},{"text":"just by thinking about these small blocks","width":258},{"text":"right so every time I see an odd numbered block, I'm going to start off the merge process to make myself a bigger block","width":640},{"text":"and so I could probably write that code just to deal with these smaller blocks","width":257},{"text":"the accounting, keeping track of all the statuses of these little blocks is not too hard","width":448},{"text":"and then when I finish making all of my lighter blue, my cyan blocks, then I'll just...","width":395},{"text":"give the rest of the problem to my original part1 code and just let it run through that","width":604},{"text":"right I should probably stop here because unfortunately...","width":373},{"text":"you are all two bright, you want to do better than this","width":318},{"text":"here's the danger, A writing C code is hard","width":196},{"text":"I'll give you an example of that on Friday when I talk about Toyota's C code and their embedded code inside their memory management unit","width":464},{"text":"various swear words have been defined to describe just what a mess this C code was","width":516},{"text":"so that's the first thing, look writing C code is hard, writing any code is hard","width":312},{"text":"second is that thinking about this algorithm is hard","width":267},{"text":"and sometimes it's good just to come up with something which","width":256},{"text":"you have high confidence in working, get that working and then have a go at something more complicated","width":538},{"text":"so I'll give you some hints about something that's a bit more complicated without going into a full algorithm","width":306},{"text":"and it's this","width":198},{"text":"let's label our blocks 0 1 2 3 4 you get the idea","width":581},{"text":"and also, we'll keep track of the blocks as to how much data they contain which is sorted","width":477},{"text":"so initially after we've done the queuesort I've got one block size of data","width":383},{"text":"and later up here I've got two block sizes of data","width":583},{"text":"so if I keep these labels","width":233},{"text":"then my labels correspond to where my blocks start in memory","width":234},{"text":"so let me call this block 0, this block 2, this block 4, this block 6","width":479},{"text":"if I do this, then I can make the following observation","width":280},{"text":"my block size gives me a strong hint to which pairs I should be merging together","width":685},{"text":"so for example, on my cyan here, if I gave you block 4, you could say oh you should be merging that with block 6","width":649},{"text":"if I gave you block 6, you could say oh you should be merging that with block 4 once they are of sufficient

well you can construct examples where we might have a very long job","width":343},{"text":"and a whole sequence of small jobs and if you did that, the long job you want to put at the very end","width":576},{"text":"otherwise it holds up everybody else, it holds up all of the other processes waiting to run","width":508},{"text":"so how do we assure that the longest job is put at the very end? answer: shortest job first, yes!","width":571},{"text":"preemptive priority you would have to make sure the priorities are based on the length of the job which is not necessarily true","width":882},{"text":"the longest average response time, what's response time? well think about a webserver, a webserver might start giving you some packets, some results pretty early on","width":649},{"text":"but it might take several more milliseconds before you get the full response, we care about how early can we get the beginning, how long do we have to wait before we start to see some output? just the early output","width":1099},{"text":"right so what's the longest average response time? first come first serve could give us a long average response time","width":667},{"text":"because the very last job submitted is not going to give us a response until finally all of the other processes have completed","width":789},{"text":"if we wanted a fast response time, what we should do is give each process access to the CPU as early as possible","width":502},{"text":"so what's an example of doing that? round robin yes!","width":210},{"text":"so round robin with a nice short preemptive, nice short quanta so that each gets to do some meaningful amount of work and start generating output","width":749},{"text":"okay minimizes response time round robin, waiting time shortest job first, total response time so this is response time of course all processes again round robin would be useful here","width":1025},{"text":"how am i doing for time? right","width":310},{"text":"the other questions I will address on Friday","width":372},{"text":"I will mention I'll just finish with one important idea","width":479},{"text":"right psychological research has shown that if you want to learn stuff, if you want to remember stuff, the most important thing you can do is remember stuff","width":477},{"text":"what do we mean by that? is use your long term memory? how do i do that? easy start with a blank piece of paper, write down everything you know about every topic inside CS241","width":686},{"text":"tomorrow, come back to the same piece of paper and write down more, do not use your notes, just write down more","width":453},{"text":"if you vaguely remember something put some question marks and some helpful hints","width":217},{"text":"the third day, do the same again","width":210},{"text":"the fourth day give up and yeah use your notes","width":154},{"text":"but you will discover that in trying to remember things, in actually exercising your brain","width":349},{"text":"stuff we start to come out of it in drips and drabs at first but it will actually ensure that you have a long term understanding of this material","width":604},{"text":"and with that have a wonderful week I'll see you on Friday!","width":221}],
